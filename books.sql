And the youngest girl is sometimes too absolutely cute for words. But the novel itself is an excellent portrait of the average life of a poor family in the late 1800s and it is very much a typical Victorian children\'s story, complete with the family\'s rescue at the end. Widow Mary Pepper and her five children eke out a meager existence living on the proceeds of her sewing jobs. But the five children, Ben, Polly, Joel, David and Phronsie, are happy, mostly healthy, and make the most of what they have even if they must eat potatoes, mush and molasses most of the time. Then a chance encounter with a wealthy boy and his dog change their lives.<br /><br />I would take off one point for this Charming Classics edition by pointing out the cover: why are there six kids? The book is FIVE little Peppers; who\'s the extra girl in front on the left?',NULL,5),(20,185,'Charming but dated and overly dramatic','After the success of THE FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS AND HOW THEY GREW Margaret Sidney decided to follow up the domestic adventures of the impoverished Pepper family five years later.  Having left their beloved little brown house and many dear friends in Badgertown, the fatherless family is installed in the mansion of wealthy Mr. King and his son, Jasper.  But wait--there are still more children to sort out: the three Whitney boys who also live there with their mother, Mrs. King\'s sister.  Not to mention assorted friends of the older Pepper children who are thrown into the literary mix.<br /><br />Darling of the family is blond Phronsie, now 8, who still charms and captivates all she meets--Shirley Temple style.  Polly at 16 is well on the road to being a heart breaker as the boys already vie for her attention.  Now the bitter pill in all this sweetness is the presence of Mr. King\'s disagreeable sister-in-law, Mrs. Chatterton, who proves herself an insufferable snob and hypochondriac; she has no use for the lower classes--with whom she is forced to share living quarters.  Can this disdainful socialite be tamed to appreciate the homespun values inseminated by Mamsie (Mrs. Pepper)?<br /><br />This ook may prove difficult to swallow for 21st century tweens, who prefer fast action, modern social interaction and dialogue.  Many terms are dated in this turn-of-the century story, which might require brief research to understand (such as childhood remedies and articles of clothing) in this gentle introduction to a by-gone, pre-automotive era.  The author includes some references to events in the first book, which will surely delight Five Little Pepper fans. Spiced up by a surprise wedding, two instances of burglars, a broken leg and a shooting the book may still prove a challenge to captivate modern young readers.',NULL,3),(21,185,'The Five Little Peppers Carry On','I\'ve really enjoyed reading the entire Five Little Peppers series as an adult, after having decided to revisit the first book almost two decades after first reading it, and then deciding to go all the way this time and read all of the rest of the books.  Reading this series as an adult as opposed to a preteen is a different experience, but the books do still hold charm and sweetness, and contain lovely portraits of this bygone world that no longer exists in anyone\'s living memory.  The over the top sentimentalism and excessive emotionalism that bugged me in the first two books actually wasn\'t that much of an issue in this book, probably because the Peppers are much older now and it\'s no longer really appropriate for them to constantly cry, scream, yell, or go into raptures.  Margaret Sidney also had a number of limitations as a writer (let\'s be honest, these books don\'t exactly hold up as well and seem as timeless as other books from the 19th century, like \'Little Women\' or \'Tom Sawyer\'), but I would never go so far as to say she\'s a horrible writer either.<br /><br />The book opens when Polly, now twenty years old, has finally realised her childhood dream of being a piano teacher for young single ladies.  She teaches at a school run by a Miss Salisbury, and is in quite a pickle because fifteen year old Amy Loughead, one of her worst pupils, is begging her to give her an extra lesson so she can prove to her older brother Jack that she\'s a good musician and worthy to be taken on his upcoming trip abroad.  This causes one of the signature crises in this series, because helping Amy at that time means breaking a date Polly made with Pickering Dodge.  Since nothing ever happens without an overkill of drama in this series, it\'s turned into some huge scandal and selfish shameful thing, all because Polly put her job over some date.  Pickering, meanwhile, is only one of several men who has his eyes on Polly and wants to marry her during this book.  Livingston Bayley, Jack Loughead, and Jasper King also have designs on her.  Other dramas that unfold during the course of this book are the sudden arrival of the now-deceased Mrs. Chatterton\'s great-niece Charlotte (who\'s thrown at us as a full-blown character with apparently a fair bit of history with these people, and it\'s conveniently never really explained just why everyone has such a hideous attitude towards her), Mr. King\'s disgust at and disapproval of Jasper\'s chosen profession in the publishing industry, Joel and David\'s troubles at college, and a train accident which involves the long recuperation on a nearby farmstead of several of the characters.  Mr. King\'s daughter Marian is injured in a sleigh accident, and Polly goes to visit her, but unfortunately the majority of this visit takes place off-screen.  It really annoys me how events and dialogues which seem really interesting and important often are narrated only after the fact, or aren\'t described at all.  Another of the author\'s shortcomings is her over-reliance on dialogue, instead of letting the action be carried along by more descriptive/narrative passages.  Mrs. Pepper/Fisher has also had a baby with Dr. Fisher, King (often called King Fisher, which makes the name King even worse), though we\'re never told exactly how old this kid is, and it doesn\'t seem logical to introduce him after he\'s already born instead of having her be pregnant or giving birth early in the book.  And since oldest child Ben is 21, Mrs. Pepper/Fisher had to be in her early forties when she had this sixth child who adds nothing to the plot and isn\'t even old enough to get his own storyline!  (I also missed Dick Whitney, who only takes part in about one scene.  In addition to Joel, I think he\'s my favorite character!)<br /><br />There\'s also some business near the beginning about Phronsie hosting Xmas celebrations at the Dunraven orphanage, which she\'s either opened or financially helped out with the money that Mrs. Chatterton bequeathed to her as her sole heir.  There\'s more silly overblown drama during these chapters when Joel decides to go back home to fetch a trunk of toys they forget and a new African-American girl wants to sit on the stage with Phronsie as she leads the festivities.  (I thought it was really creepy how Phronsie made all of the kids repeat lines about how they have this home thanks to Mrs. Chatterton and they\'re so happy she gave them the home.  It just seemed like brainwashing, however benevolent the intent.)  About half of one of the Xmas chapters is also given over to recapping their first Xmas in their \"little brown house.\"  This is just lazy writing.  It adds nothing to the plot, and if I wanted to waltz down memory lane and relive their first Xmas, I\'d reread the first book!  It just annoys me when I see the Peppers and their entourage starting up the oversentimentalisation of their \"little brown house days,\" AGAIN, like they\'ve conveniently forgotten how horrible it was to be so terribly poor and when they had almost nothing.  I get that they were happy and had one another in spite of the poverty, but after they\'ve gotten out of that life, why are they so eager to go climbing back over and over again?<br /><br />I wished we\'d been able to see more of the Pepper boys in this book, since their storylines at this point seem more interesting than those of Polly and Phronsie, who are stuck at home in an era when girls and women didn\'t really have the option of equal education and going away to college.  I also thought that 13 year old Phronsie, who annoyed me during the first book and much of the second book, was more grown-up, mature, and self-aware than the 20 year old Polly by this point!  I\'m liking her more and more with each passing book, whereas I\'m no longer feeling that sympathetic toward Polly anymore.  Maybe it\'s because there\'s so much dialogue that there\'s not a lot of room for developing the characters through descriptive passages or describing their inner thoughts.  I also thought Polly\'s explanation to Phronsie, following the death of a friend, was monstrous, saying that she shouldn\'t be unhappy and think God did a bad thing, since God actually did a great thing in having this girl die, because otherwise her mom might never want to go to heaven if she didn\'t have someone waiting there for her.  This was seriously how death was described to a child in the 1890s?  The marriage proposal Polly finally accepts in the end also struck me as really lame and anti-climactic, considering how long the reader has probably been waiting for this moment.  And of course, the book ends without the long-awaited wedding, which will already have happened by the time the final book in the series opens, seven years after these events.  It\'s not that I don\'t enjoy these books, it\'s just that it can be frustrating to read them because of the numerous shortcomings Margaret Sidney had as a writer.',NULL,4),(22,185,'The life and times of a simple, poor, happy family (a widow with five children) growing up and getting by in the 1880s','I originally started reading this book about 18 years ago, after I first read the first book in the series, though I never finished it.  After having reread the first book recently, I decided to give this one another go.  In some ways it\'s more mature than the first book, because the characters are older and the storylines are a bit more interesting.  I still noticed the excessive exclamation points, how everyone seems to scream, cry, yell, or go into a rapture at the drop of a hat, but if you\'re reading Victorian literature, you have to accept the fact that that type of over the top sentimentalism was a large part of the writing style of the day.  The Pepper children are still unbelievably good and happy, but no longer as annoyingly so as in the first book, and since we see more of the two sisters than anyone else in this book, it\'s a bit easier to take.<br /><br />Five years after the first book ended, the Peppers are still living with the Kings and Whitneys in Mr. King\'s large mansion, and have been warmly lovingly accepted by just about everyone from that social set.  Everyone, that is, except Mr. King\'s visiting cousin Mrs. Eunice Chatterton.  I personally thought her views were more in line with the average person of the era\'s views, as 19th century America was such a classist society and probably wouldn\'t have taken too well to the idea of a poor family being taken into the house of a very rich family.  I wished that storyline had been allowed to build a lot longer instead of Mrs. Chatterton gradually coming around, since it\'s just boring when every single character is a good guy and gets along.  I was also annoyed when Polly, after finally standing up for herself and ripping Mrs. Chatterton a new one for having insulted her poor upbringing, feels horrible immediately afterwards because she talked back to an adult, and even begs Mr. King to keep this hideous unpleasant person in the house.  (We\'re also never told what exactly Polly said to her during this tirade; obviously, given the era and Polly\'s character, it\'s not like she were dropping F-bombs or something!)<br /><br />The story also dragged for me when they all decide to take a winter vacation to their old \"little brown house.\"  This just doesn\'t strike me as realistic, not only for the era, but also for the mere fact that the average person who\'s been poor doesn\'t exactly like to revisit those days!  Once you\'ve gotten out of poverty and are finally doing well for yourself, even if you\'re seemingly living on the charity of others instead of living on your own and pulling in your own riches, why would you want to waltz down memory lane by going back to your old abode and even living there while on vacation?  I don\'t think even someone from the Victorian era would have extended the sentimentalism to poverty!<br /><br />I think what I liked most about this book, apart from the touches of an earlier era (such as the concept of going away to school, phonograph dolls, and the view that being a private music tutor was a great and common career path for a woman), was how Phronsie finally started to grow up by the end.  At first I was annoyed that she still talked and acted like the three year old of the original volume, in spite of now being about eight years old, but I was really pleasantly surprised at how she started to show more self-awareness and maturity.  For example, she decides to give some of her 200+ dolls away to orphans, and actually shows the best attitude to Mrs. Chatterton, instead of continuing to bear a grudge against her for her earlier behavior.  (I thought it was horrible when Mr. King insisted that Phronsie not take the doll that Mrs. Chatterton bought for her, since he didn\'t like her and felt that only he could get the household\'s pet a doll.)  I really hope that all of that progress won\'t be erased in \'Five Little Peppers Abroad\'!<br /><br />Even though these books can be a bit challenging to read at times, given the overwhelming Victorian sentimentality and not always believable storylines, I really do enjoy reading about these characters and their adventures.  I know that some children\'s serials get more and more mature and complex as they go on, and if this second book is any indication, I hope that the succeeding books in the series only continue to get better and more interesting.',NULL,3),(23,185,'Teenage life in Victorian Boston','I have heard of this book nearly all my life. One of my favorite books growing up was Cheaper by the Dozen, by Franker Bunker Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey, about their parents, Frank B. and Lillian Moller Gilbreth, and how they raised their twelve children. One of Mother\'s favorite books to read aloud to the Gilbreth children was Five Little Peppers and How They Grew, and it is said that she \"was particularly partial to a character named Phronsie, or something like that.\" However, I had never read it myself. In the years since, I have seen it in bookstores but never bought it. However, when I came across it recently at a used curriculum sale for $1.00, I picked it up immediately. The Pepper family lives in the little brown house located in Badgertown (probably in Massachusetts). Mr. Pepper has died and the widowed mother was left to raise the children by herself. In order of age (descending), the children\'s names were Ben (Ebenezer), Polly (Mary), Joel, David, and Phronsie (Sophronia). They have no money and little education, but they have lots of love and a good mother to guide them through good times and bad. Mrs. Pepper (Mamsie) works at tailoring things and especially sewing sacks for the local storekeeper. Polly, who is ten years old, helps her sew while making sure the children behave and preparing their dinner. Ben, who is a year older than Polly, works all day at a nearby farm chopping wood. (This was obviously before child labor laws!) They come in contact with Jasper King, a boy a little older than Ben, who is on vacation at nearby Hingham with his rich widowed father. Eventually, the Peppers come to stay with Jasper and his sister and nephews at his big house in the city (probably Boston) where they finally unravel a very interesting mystery.<br />  Some people today might consider Five Little Peppers and How They Grew hopelessly out of date and completely irrelevant to the \"real world\" of modern society. So what?  It undoubtedly represents the \"real world\" that many people faced back in the late 1800s. And I believe it represents what the \"real world\" should be in a family when there is genuine love. The Pepper children are not \"ipsy-pipsy perfect.\" They do complain about their hard lot from time to time and occasionally get into some mischief. However, they are being taught by their mother how to face their trials and problems with a thankful heart and a cheerful attitude, concepts that very little modern children\'s literature portrays. Belief in God is mentioned, and the local minister and his family are very helpful. The language is a little old-fashioned and was probably intended to imitate the idiom of relatively uneducated people of the day, but it can easily be understood. I liked this book and think that it is an interesting snapshot of what times were like in the 1880s.',NULL,5),(24,185,'Like bones gains','I bought this because I loved the five little Peppers as a child, but unlike some early children\'s series (Maida, the Alcotts, even the original &#34;Carolyn Keenes&#34;) this is far too muddied with real and unreal social history and modeling.  No one ever walks into a room--they bolt, trip, dance, dash, race, etc., etc.  Everyone, including the preadolescent boys, cries all the time (usually after throwing themselves onto some surface--sofa, stairs, ground, etc.).  Everyone is perfect.  If not, they\'re pathologically guilt-ridden about it.  Everyone gushes about everything, unless they\'re sobbing about it.  The plot (which is minimal) is idiotic, and the social conventions, terms, and expectations of the early 20th c., as we\'re discovering from Paula Dean, who apparently brought them with her into the 21st, are wholly unacceptable.

They also made the movies based on the books. This book series is a great read for any age group. Little boys love these books also. I would suggest to read the book first then watch the movie after the book. They are short movies, and the kids will be so into the 2nd book and by the end you have a family tradistion. Our Christmas movie is Little Lord Flontaroy(not sure about spelling) then once the house settles down New Years Eve and New Years Day its the 5 Little Peppers(movies)  AND  THE CHRISTMAS JARS(book 1).  That is when we start thinking about how were going to help those who need a little extra help.',NULL,5),(29,185,'Practically Perfect','I read these books as a girl fifty eight years ago and loved them.

You become involved the whole family their struggles and accomplishments become so real that you begin to be caught up in the story.',NULL,5),(30,185,'A Childhood Favorite','I recalled reading and loving the book as a child. We recently listened to the audio version of the book, as narrated by Bernadette Dunne, 9 hours of tapes, on a 700 mile journey from PA to Indiana with four young children in the car.  The children were totally enthralled. Four hours in, Daddy would have driven the car into a tree to end the misery had the tale not turned the corner from a horribly contrived and predicatable shower of sugar to a joyful over-the-top opportunity for satire. Anyone who does not understand this description just look up the Monty Python sketch entitled \"Four Yorkshiremen\" on YouTube for enlightenment.<br />The children were utterly disappointed in the anticlimactic and contrived ending but since that time the story has provided endless joy around the home.  Complaints about the lack of familiar luxuries are answered with quotes or verbal satire of the characters from the story.  Even the youngest child will repeat \"Oh, Mamsie, could we please have twigs or hard raisins for breakfast?\" when a complaint of an improperly toasted PopTart is voiced.  So, as you sip from your handleless teacup, waiting for \"your ship to come in\", we only hope you garner one tenth of the enjoyment we have experienced after surviving an entire reading.

Unlike nearly all the other Kindle versions of the Five Little Peppers books I have come across, this one has almost no typos and great formatting. It is the &#34;Midway&#34; between Five Little Peppers and How They Grew and Five Little Peppers Grown Up.<br />A beautiful addition to the Five Little Peppers series, I definitely recommend that you get this book!',NULL,5),(32,185,'An Enduring Delight','This book is written in the style of its time (first published in 1881).  It is the tale of an appealing and almost-implausibly loving family of five children their mother.  Their father has died and they are managing, though barely, on their own.  Poverty is continuous but not oppressive.  The Peppers are resourceful and vigorous.  The children lack for nothing when it comes to love, and must substitute industry and premature responsibilities for academic education.<br />They seem not to suffer much.  The devotion of their mother to their well being, and the jollity and flair for fun the children possess temper what might otherwise be, for modern children, a frightening prospect.  I read this book to my almost-six year old daughter, who was enthralled, enchanted and amused by the exploits of these five youngsters.  Their serious bout with measles, their poor circumstances, their unquenchable good spirits, and their close relationships provided plenty of drama for this chi! ld who does not depend on special effects or motorized games for entertainment.  In other words, though the story is old fashioned, even obvious and unsubtle in its moral message of love and devotion, it is still rich with possibilities for a child with imagination.<br />It is a kind of fairy tale, in the end, as the family circumstances are changed due to a somewhat fantastical coincidence of relatedness with a family of considerable means.  But children have no trouble suspending their disbelief, and they love happy endings.  The essential values are ones to which families of today still ascribe:  love, devotion, simplicity, self reliance, and more.  Its old fashioned flavor is one of its charms, particularly for children (and their parents) who have an affinity for things old fashioned, and whose language ability can accommodate more formal speech and turns of phrase now in disuse.<br />My daughter is hounding me for sequels, of which there are many, and of which I was unaware.  ! I recommend this book to families who want to acquaint thei! r children with times past and the timeless qualities that are possible within families.  It is a good and quiet book with simple, if difficult problems, and characters any child would do well to emulate.  It would interest children who have enjoyed &quot;Sarah Plain and Tall,&quot; and the &quot;Little House&quot; books, among others.',NULL,4),(33,185,'An overlooked gem of children\'s literature gets a well-deserved new reading','Five Little Peppers and How They Grew, by Harriett Mulford Stone (but published under Margaret Sidney), is a valuable little piece of history, wrapped in a sugary sweet shell of family life.<br /><br />At well over one hundred years in age, Five Little Peppers harks back to The Little House on the Prairie, though not a true contemporary- Five Little Peppers is some fifty years older, and is set not in the wilderness of the west, but in a small neighborhood on the east coast of America.<br /><br />Written for its own time, the story is that of a young woman, Polly, her three brothers and sister, and their widowed mother. The reader enters in the middle of one lean time, connected at both ends to a series of even worse stretches. The hardworking solidarity of the family would be too much to believe, but each of the children is a perfect experiment in character development- all of the children live to please Polly and Mother, and to help the family continue to scrape by.<br /><br />Polly\'s mother is a seamstress, sewing dresses, coats and sacks for those better off. The boys help as they can, running errands and chopping wood, and Polly sews and manages the house. This may not, in the beginning, sound like the most interesting read, but it is so well salted with historic treasures, dispensed in the most offhand fashion, that a modern reader can\'t help but be enthralled by the perfect picture of nineteenth century poverty.<br /><br />The details are what make the story- not only in the perfectly rendered personalities of the characters and the warm fuzzies that each small trial, overcome, imparts, but also in the time period. You live in, or at least near, the time of Stone herself, and with every clopping hoof or towering, horrible steam engine, it pulls you deeper- while the novelty of poverty may have been enhanced and sanitized for the readers of the time, it still is rich with insight. The medicinal practices- brown paper sticking plasters and doses like tar- smack you alongside the head with their sheer ineffectiveness, while the family\'s ancient wood burning stove looms as the greatest nemesis in Polly\'s life; the reader begins to cheer with her when a meal comes out unburned, and the suspense as match is applied to tinder is surprising. These and a thousand other small details build a world as wonderful and inviting as any fantasy book.<br /><br />Along with the sweetness and the historical value, the book actually carries along an interesting plot. Mostly, this is cyclical in nature- the family is beset, fights off the attacking world with bravery and resourcefulness, and is perhaps a little better off than they were before. The overarching movement of the book is not apparent until the reader reaches the end, when they can look back down the long slope and feel a sense of satisfaction at having reached this final point.<br /><br />Five Little Peppers and How They Grew is a wonderful book for anyone, young or old, who wants to snuggle down and have a good read.<br /><br />[...]',NULL,5),(34,185,'Lovely characters, lovely story...','At the end of Five Little Peppers Midway, the girls, Mr. and Mrs. Fisher, Jasper, and Grandpa King are leaving for a voyage to Europe. This is the story of their journey, from shipboard acquaintances with a rude English boy and with a social-climbing classmate of Polly\'s and her mother, to sightseeing in England, France, Holland, and Italy. Although the Peppers are as effusive as ever, this is a wonderful portrait of what it was like to do \"the Grand Tour\" of Europe back in the last 1800s, unfortunately complete with stereotypes, but true to life with the danger of bad hotels and food and strenuous travel.',NULL,5),(35,185,'\"My whockety! What a lot!\"','You know, the Five Little Peppers are always good for a re-read, but recently I read them very soon after rereading \"Little Women.\"  The two books are similar in their construction and setting:  both about large families with a missing father (the Peppers\' has died), trying to make ends meet, behave well, and generally grow up as they go along.  But whereas \"Little Women\" is sort of quiet and preachy, the Peppers are always bucketing along, shrilly screaming, yelling, falling, fighting.  Almost every sentence is an exclamation, or a booming pronouncement, and every little thing that occurs is a dramatic situation.  I was quite exhausted after realizing this (of course it occurred to me early on, so the rest of the book I was feeling wearied by it all).<br /><br />After reading many childrens\' books where the scenarios are not so rushed and dramatic, I find the Peppers series to suffer, but only on this account.  It does provide a charming story of a slower-paced era.  However, I\'d recommend \"Swallows and Amazons,\" or any of E. Nesbit\'s books, before this one, just because Ransome and Nesbit treat their books like novels for a younger audience, whereas Sidney treats hers as a kids\' book, where everything has to attract attention.',NULL,3),(36,185,'A family story','I recently re-read this book, which I\'d enjoyed as a child (forty years ago). Today, it seems rather dismal to me - horrible poverty, illness, the pat happy ending and children who are horribly gushing over their mother. Yet, years back, what I most liked about the story was that, being a very independent and mature child myself, Polly and Ben succeed very well at taking on adult responsibilities.<br />Though I\'m at a loss about explaining exactly how the author does so, I\'ve found that this is a book which every reader interprets differently - and that shows an amazing depth. My own mother remembers reading it as a child, and being moved by the familial devotion and respect for the matriarch. As other posts here make clear, it can reach each of us on a different level.<br />This book is a worthy addition to any child\'s library. However, I\'d leave a single caveat: do not use it to prompt &quot;a talk,&quot; especially on the &quot;look how good you have it today&quot; theme. Let the era introduce itself. It was a time of great poverty for many, yet also one which idealised a form of &quot;perfect&quot; family relationships which no one could hope to have. The combination of gritty realism with idealistic dreams has a message that kids will grasp on their own, and probably quite inventively.',NULL,5),(37,185,'Beautiful Classic','Five Little Peppers Midway is a continuation of the lives of The Pepper Family.

Scarlett O\'Hara from Gone With the Wind, Father Ralph and Meggie from The Thorn Birds, Ari Ben Canaan and Kitty from Exodus.  And to this list I now add the name Emma Harte.<br /><br />A Woman of Substance is a grand book told over close to six decades and also introduces us to the Yorkshire area of England as well as the cities of Leeds and London.

A lot has changed now and I am happy to say that I am relatively healthy.<br /><br />\"A Woman of Substance\" is a novel that I read in my moments of despair. It is a thick novel to read when one is sick, but it is quite interesting. The writer, Barbara Taylor Bradford is able to depict the life of an entrepreneur, Emma Harte and the creation of her business empire.<br /><br />Harte is the paragon of success in the Western world. She came from little beginnings to create a chain of stores that are well known. Notwithstanding, her love life is not that good. She falls in love with her boss\' son Edwin Fairley and gets pregnant. Edwin refuses to marry Emma to her chagrin. Emma flees to the city to protect herself and her child from gossip.<br /><br />Emma gets married, but her husband dies. She meets a young Australian soldier(Paul McGill) and falls in passionately in love with him. Paul also dies as well but he leaves her with his estate.<br /><br />After Paul\'s death, Emma continues to raise her children. She becomes old and realizes that her own children are perfidious.

She was an immoral and unlikable character, and it was difficult to read 900 pages about a character whom I lack any compassion for.  My first grievance about the novel is the inconsistency spread throughout the plot about basic facts.  In the beginning, the author describes Emma as having about a 5 year age difference with her lifelong friend, Blackie.  However, toward the end of the novel, they are only 3 years apart.  In one chapter, Emma Harte is 29 years old, but about a year later (in the next chapter), she is only 28 years old.  Secondly, Bradford creates likeable supporting characters throughout the novel, and then she suddenly turns them into repulsive beings whenever it is convenient for her to build Emma up or to get rid of them.  For example, Emma\'s first husband was just a shy, orphaned landlord who was very generous and loving toward her.  However, to build the reader\'s compassion for Emma, the author suddenly turned him into an inconsiderate dud in the sack, which was completely unnecessary.  How can I sympathize with Emma when she married a man devoted to her, but whom she used and didn\'t love.  The author reaches too far to justify Emma\'s actions by aiming to create an unlikeable character in the husband.  Emma\'s first dalliance was with Edwin, who was at first a very loveable, gentile boy.  Then, the author turns him into a sudden coward in order to make Emma appear battered and stronger.  (I also found it irritating that the author included at least five men who were madly in love with Emma throughout the book - just a bit too extreme).  At further moments, the author paints a picture where Emma is grieved by her relationship with her hateful eldest daughter, but she was, for the most part, an absent and uninvolved parent.  Many children would be bitter under the same circumstance, yet the author victimizes Emma for her daughter\'s lack of love toward her.  The author has to turn her second husband into a philandering homosexual to overshadow Emma\'s own adultery.  Basically, the author had to make everyone else look despicable to make Emma look strong, when in opinion, Emma never grasped the importance of friendships and relationships over money.  So I find it hard to believe that Emma was a strong, powerful, admirable woman.  She thrived on hatred, and used people to accomplish her goals of burying those she hated.  Therefore, the book didn\'t provide for me what its title promised.',NULL,2),(130,186,'Five Stars','Very good',NULL,4),(131,186,'You\'ll Keep Coming Back','I have read nearly all of Barbara\'s books, but Woman of Substance is the  most fascinating of all.

The lushness of her prose and her descriptive abilities have never been used in quite this way, and as Allende describes the virginal South American wilds, I was left in amazement at her accomplishment. I have always admired Allende as a writer, but I have been frustrated in the past at what I have seen as her unnecessary and detracting forays into the supernatural, which has intruded (as in House of the Spirits) into an otherwise rational plot. Nothing precisely like that comes to pass in this book, and insofar as it does, it seems less an affront in its setting here than it had at other times, and that also impressed me.<br /><br />Inés of My Soul tells the story of a real life sixteenth-century figure, the bold and enterprising survivor, Doña Inés Suárez, who, along with her lover, the dashing Don Pedro de Valdivia, founds the great city of Santiago, Chile. Writing a remembrance from the vantage point of extreme old age (seventy years and near death) Doña Inés tells of growing up in Spain, then of course the world\'s most powerful and wealthy nation, and also describes to the reader her eventual voyage to Peru, in search of her husband, Juan, who had traveled to the New World before his wife, as one of Pizarro\'s conquistadors. Upon learning that her husband has died in battle (and finding that the man was not all she had once thought him to be) Doña Inés, left there in Peru with initially limited options, eventually is swept away by a dashing warrior and lover named Don Pedro de Valdivia.  Together the pair go on to make the journey south to the wilds and are afterward remembered as among the founding figures in the modern nation of Chile. From her antiquity, Doña Inés tells the story of all this, and does so in a way that mesmerizes the imagination even as she---or more accurately Allende---teases the intellect and almost makes one forget until reminded of the human toll that was inextricably part of wedding together the distant lands of Chile and Spain.<br /><br />I found this to be an enjoyable and visually-powerful work of fiction. It impressed me in a number of ways, and I recommend it to those who admire this gifted South American writer, who feel drawn to its historical and geographical setting, or to anyone looking for a good read this season.',NULL,5),(206,188,'Supurb Historical Fiction','“Courage is a virtue appreciated in a male but considered a defect in our gender. Bold women are a threat to a world that is badly out of balance, in favor of men. That is why they work so hard to mistreat us and destroy us. But remember that bold women are like cockroaches: step on one and others come running from the corners.\"-- Inés (speaking to Cecilia)<br /><br />Another well written historical novel by Isabel Allende that doesn\'t disappoint. The characters are three dimensional, and the story is interesting. A female conquistador.',NULL,4),(207,188,'Historical fiction','This novel is one of the few historical fiction works set in renaissance South America, so of course I had to read it as part of my `renaissance around the world\' trek. Besides which, the topic interest me; I often speak on the indigenous habitat of llamas, and confess to a certain `history gap\' below Peru.<br /><br />Ines of my Soul is rather Jean-Plaidy-like in its concept: follow a known historical character with an interesting life from birth to death, hitting all the events important to posterity along the way.<br />If you are interested in the history of Chile, of which Ines Suarez was the founding \'first lady\', this novel is a good start. It might be recommended to students, except that Ms. Allende had at least four interludes where she inserted detailed positional descriptions of sex, which, as they were preceded by nothing in the way of romantic build-up, had all the erotic force of a bovine breeding manual as told first-person from the viewpoint of the cow.<br /><br />The book is not a scintillating page turner, but does an honest workmanlike job of covering the basics. Allende doesn\'t soft-peddle the atrocities, either. Starting with the sack of Rome by the forces of Charles V, the book dwells at length on the gory injustice of war. She does pop out-of-character to give you the viewpoint of one of the native war-chiefs (complete with more veterinary descriptions of sex having absolutely nothing to do with the story) which seemed a little awkward. But the memoir mechanism was already in tatters anyway; let\'s face it, would a sixteenth-century renaissance-era woman, upon dictating her memoirs to her daughter, reveal such details?<br /><br />I had a hard time liking Pedro de Valdivia. Allende did show that his circumstances changed him for the worse. I can\'t quite put my finger on why this didn\'t work for me, because she spent a lot of time outlining his idealistic and noble intentions as a youth. Just too much narrative and too little emotion, I think. Perhaps if she had been more skillful in drawing his character as sympathetic I would have been a little sorrier that he became so hard. As it was, I\'m afraid I was mostly hoping he would get his just deserts sooner instead of later.<br /><br />Overall the novel plodded more than it sang. The descriptions and atmosphere were nice. But way too much tell, far too little show.',NULL,3),(208,188,'A historical novel full of romance and violence, magic and history','Ines of my soul is the second work of Allende\'s I have read. Sadly, I have still not read House of Spirits, her grand opus, but having read Eva Luna, I can say this is not bad at all.<br /><br />Ines Suarez,  a widow, who falls for the conqueror of Chile, Pedro de Valdivia is at once a heroine, villain, and pitiful creature. She embarks on a journey to find her husband, only to discover that he is dead. His demise now opens a window of opportunity, or should I say fate, that leads her to Pedro and together, they are inexorably linked to the founding of Chile. Ines is seen as a heroine, when she defends her beloved city from Indian invaders-indeed a very explicit account of decapitation by a woman, and yet we call them the weaker sex( hmm).She is vilified by the inquisition and other jealous Spaniards around for various reasons- her adulterous union with Pedro; her position as gobernodora; the lands and riches bequeath her etc. However, her treament by Valdivia was the point of pity. It took him three years to explain why he had left her,and this to me was his(Valdivia\'s) lowest point.<br /><br />Pedro de Valvivia has been described by various history books, but suffice it to say here that he was purely  a man of his time.One should not expect anything less.<br /><br />As a historical account, the novel does brilliantly. In it I am able to capture the zeitgeist of sixteenth century Spain: the influence of the church, and the general hypocrisy that made women subservient and subjugated. Here, looting an enemy\'s camp, raping the women, and enslaving the populace, \"for God, King and country\", seems to be the prevaling mantra. In our modern society, not much has changed; the same attitudes prevail under a different guise; perhaps slavery, at least in  that form , does not exist; the new subterfuge being ,\"emancipation of the people\".This novel is quite instructive, as  soldiers over the centuries have behaved the same way -Iraq, Afghanistan being the most recent examples.<br /><br />The only aspect I would criticise in the novel is the way it was written. I expected more in the use of language, a little more linguistic sophistication and magic realism that Allende is noted for. This I found a bit lacking in the novel as a whole. Was this deliberate?  There is beauty in simplicity, but then there is also beauty in how something is conveyed. Maybe that was the author\'s intention, to present this in a lay woman\'s words, without the sophistication that would be attributed to erudition.<br /><br />As a whole, a good read. Entertaining and stimulating. It raises certain questions about love, fidelity, the concept of savagery and civilisation, and which of us possesses the more informed and enlightened approach. Everything is relative, and perhaps we are all mestizos :a complex amalgam of what is good and bad about the human race.',NULL,3),(209,188,'Entertaining','This is one of those books that you will be sad to finish.

Her characters were not to be embraced; flat and not endearing and/or people you can hate.  Ines takes off from Spain in search of her husband... (remember her character in Daughter of Fortune?)  sounds familiar to me. Ines becomes the main backbone of the settlers while searching for Chilean settlements.. nurse/doctor, provider of food/crops, wise and compassionate yet turns a blind eye to suffering of the Indians.  What do you think the reference to 9/11 was all about?  My book club LOVED Dauther of Fortune and Portrait in Sepia, but I certainly will NOT recommend this book.

In the springtime, she reports they at last have fruit to eat--what fruits ripen in the spring?  An entire battalion of soldiers disguises themselves in sheets--where would there be that many precious and costly sheets in the 16th century?

Her investigation and opinions on spirituality are particularly intriguing to me. She creates strong female characters that come across as realistic and layered. Allende subtly mixes her personal ideas and reactions to 9/11 into a narrative set long ago.  This novel is particularly thought-provoking when read with the mind-set of universal human interests (such as power and conquest) and the idea of history repeating itself.

A real epic novel of war and romance, it has been called a \"Gone with the Wind\" set in India and Afghanistan. It is a long adventure that weaves through many of the small \"kingdoms\" that made up India during the 1800\'s and the time of Britain\'s attempted hold on the country and its forays into trying to take over and hold Afghanistan.<br /><br />M.M. Kaye, the writer, knew the landscape and territory she wrote about well because her father was a decorated, \"Guide,\" in the British Army.  the Guides were in the 1800\'s and early 1900\'s the special forces of the day.  It has been written that her lead character of Ashton, completely able to blend in with the colorful, fierce Afghan Pashtun tribes, was modeled after her father.<br /><br />People who know this book - love it and read it again and again. The characters are memorable and one finds oneself wanting to return to re-experience them and the mythical landscapes that M.M. Kaye creates. Stephen King, whom I would not normally think of as liking this sort of romantic, historical genre, has praised it.<br /><br />Even though I have undergraduate degrees in History, Theater and Literature I was not familiar with this book.

Kaye does a wonderfully cinematic job in this mammoth romantic novel of re-creating the India of the British Raj from the point of view of the governed.  Her central plot device is not new:  Rudyard Kipling’s masterpiece “Kim” imagines a Bombay street urchin comfortable with all castes and classes of India who is discovered to be an orphan of a British sergeant  and is drafted into the service of the Raj as a spy.  Kipling also imagined a grown-up but well-born version of Kim who disguises himself as a horse groom in order to be near to and protect the woman he loves.  Kaye’s hero, Ashton Pelham-Martin is orphaned as an infant when his scholar/adventurer parents are swept way during an outbreak of cholera in their camp;  the infant is raised by his nurse, who calls him Ashok, and not until he reaches adolescence does she reveal on her deathbed that he is really an Angrezi.<br />We follow Ashok’s childhood in the intrigue-ridden palace of a Sultan, his developing friendship with the sultan’s abused daughter Anjuli (forced into a Cinderella role by her evil stepmother), the daring escape from the palace of Ashok and his foster mother, and the sudden drastic change in Ashok’s life brought by his transformation into an English gentleman, educated by and adopted into  Victoria’s Corps of  Guides, the premier British regiment serving in India (in which Kaye’s father-in-law and husband had also served.)<br />Ashok, now Ashton, returns to India as a young officer of the Guides, and as a junior officer is assigned to escort two royal princesses to their wedding.  You can figure out a lot of what happens next without my telling you, but  “The Far Pavilions”  is a rousing read for the first 864 pages.<br /><br />I have to admit that the last 325 pages are a bit of a slog.  M.M Kaye could not dodge the actual history of the period, and fabricating some sort of happy ending to an unhappy period in British colonial history took some doing.

The tale follows the life of Ashton Pelham-Martyn, also known as Ashok, a man who straddles several cultures in nineteenth-century India.  The son of aristocratic English parents, he is taken into hiding and raised as a Hindu boy by his nurse after his parents are killed and revolution breaks out.  \"Ashok\" grows up as a servant in the royal palace of the small kingdom of Gulkote, near the Himalayan mountains (the titular Far Pavilions).  He developes a special friendship with Anjuli, the out-of-favor daughter of the Raj, whose mother died and was supplanted by a dangerous schemer.  Anjuli and Ashok tell each other stories of the magical kingdom they will one day rule together, stories which help sustain them through the cruel intrigues of the royal court.<br /><br />When those intrigues almost cost Ash his life, however, he is smuggled out of Gulkote and returned to England to claim his birthright, only returning many years later as an adult in the Royal army.  With his special understanding of the cultures and perspectives of India, he still finds his \"own\" culture alien and insensitive, and discovers that perhaps nothing can stop the revolutionary movements that are battling more and more violently against British rule.<br /><br />A chance assignment reunites him with Anjuli, now a grown woman who has managed to survive the intrigues of the court but whose days are clearly numbered.  Ultimately, as India ignites around them, they will have to flee together to seek out the kingdom of their childhood dreams, but the journey along the way is memorable, astonishing, and will haunt YOUR dreams.<br /><br />Kaye\'s story is remarkably vivid and detailed, full of well-researched detail that\'s made all the more accurate by the fact that Kaye, too, was born in India and educated in England.  The story actually derives from tales she had heard in India of a strange wedding.  When she found the diary of an English officer who had been involved in the real-life incident, she realized she had the makings of a fascinating story.

The last 1/3rd which is all about Afghanistan - I found very contemporary - because Afghans haven\'t changed a hair in the last 200 years.<br /><br />She knew her history, and knew the places well. She has the people of that region nailed, from the British to the caste-bigoted Hindus and honorable, but rather bloodthirsty muslims. The last 1/3rd, after Ash enters Afghanistan as a spy for the British Raj during the second attempt to dominate Afghanistan is excellent. The tribesmen are still the same, still taking bribes from invaders to keep the peace or allow transit over their territory. Kabul is still the same, just larger, and still gets invaded by militias that take what they want. Kabul is still a weak government that can\'t guarantee the safety of its own, and still just as corrupt, just as useless as it was then. (Might be more useless now.)The difference today is that the USA is being the Empire builder, that\'s all. And long after the Tsar made moves on Afghanistan, the USSR finally went in and got its butt kicked just like the British did.<br /><br />It is as true now as it was 160 years ago that you can beat the Afghans in battle, even win the war, but you can\'t hold the country. They are still undisciplined soldiers with fanatical courage. They are still a largely ungovernable mess of tribes addicted to blood feuds, murder, and theft. There are still the range of mullahs, from sensible ones who advise reason to wacko fanatics wanting to slaughter all infidels.<br /><br />And for a couple in love in that part of the world, where love crosses religious and ethnic lines, who want to escape the bigotry of India, Afghanistan, and the West, (don\'t kid yourself, the Western world is still rough) finding a remote valley, far away (the far pavilion) is still a dream to pursue.<br /><br />But this is a long (very long - as in Tolstoy-War-and-Peace long) complex book.

There is a rich variety of cultures and people.<br /><br />She tackles racial, ethnic and religious bigotry like a champion. She dissects the soul of imperialism, the petty venality at its core in the persons of the ambitious. The Viceroy of India could have been Rumsfeld, ambitious and blind to all but his own vision of how things must be.<br /><br />I\'m the sort of reader who spots tiny inconsistencies, and this book had 3.

The latter is also a story worth reading, but it does create an odd shift. Even so, _The Far Pavilions_ is overall a staggering work full of memorable characters and places, emotion, intrigue, politics (identity and otherwise!), pain, and love.<br /><br />It\'s been called M.M.

I just love it, and re-read it regularly. M M Kaye is simply the most marvellous story teller, and her descriptions of India are breath-taking too.<br />It is the story of Ashton/Ashok - an English boy brought up by a peripatetic father in the foothills of the Himalayas -  he is about 6 years old when cholera strikes the camp and kills everyone but himself and his nurse. She takes him down into India to give him back to the safety of the English - but this is 1857 and India is in mutiny against the English. Ash, having been brought up amongst Indians can speak their languages fluently, and he is the right colouring to pass as one of the races from the North where they are paler. So his nurse escapes from the troubles with him and brings him up as her own son. This sets the stage for many of his later problems, the key one being that of his identity - for when  he must later seek safety with the English and his true birth is revealed he finds it difficult to know who he truly is for he is at once Indian and English. While a boy Ash meets Anjuli, a princess in the court where he is working. She is the daughter of an Indian/Russian mother - and because of her birth, and her mother\'s death in the court, she is also never really properly accepted.<br />MM Kaye sets this story against the grand displays of Indian courts, the British army (which Ashton later joins to return to India), teeming bazaars, and the different cultures and religions of India.<br />Its an enormous book to get through but it is well worth pretty much every page. I\'ve never been one for long descriptions of war, and the scenes of the siege in Afghanistan towards the end I always find a bit of a trial. That is really such a small piece of the whole novel for most of it  Ash and later Anjuli too, try to work out who they are and how they fit into India, or perhaps England.  Their relationships and identities are tested against their friends who enter their lives and for various reasons leave them again. It is at once incredibly tragic and wonderfully romantic. I fell in love with India the first time I read this book and subsequent readings haven\'t changed my opinion.<br />MM Kaye wrote two other real epics. Shadow of the Moon which I also really love, although it is a bit more romantic than this one - and Trade Winds which is set in Zanzibar as I remember - but the heroine in that just doesn\'t gel for me. The Far Pavillions is simply the best epic novel ever written (I think)',NULL,5),(248,189,'My Favorite Historic Romantic Novel!','While it was rather daunting picking up a book of 955 pages, I enjoyed the story...some parts more than others.  I am actually conflicted with the rating of 4 stars, as parts of this book were completely skimmed (2 stars), but other parts were devoured (5 stars).<br /><br />M. M. Kaye wrote a story of one man, and not all of his life was accounted for.  The Far Pavilions was an ideal for Ashton Pelham-Martyn, who was a man that did not begin to any one group; a place where he could live peacefully.  Without giving away too much of the story, it is about a boy who was born of English parents a few years before the Sepoy Mutiny in India.  Subsequently, Ashton was then called Ashok by his ayah(Indian nurse maid) and made to look like and who came to believe that he was actually Indian.  Later, he was sent to England to be schooled as an Englishman.  He then requested to go back to India in order to serve in the British Regiment, as India was in his blood.<br /><br />Many of the incidents in this book were based on facts, and some of those facts were taken from journals of the author\'s grandfather and father.  Ms. Kaye did an admirable job of greatly detailing the battles that were throughout the book.  She had taken her fictional character, Ashton, and deftly wove history around him.  I learned about the British Raj, Hinduism, Islam, India and Afghanistan from this work.  However, there was so much that was not explained, and with the length of this story, the reader only gets a taste of these elements.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I did skim several sections, particularly in the center of the story.  The first two hundred pages had me completely gripped in the world of Ashton, turned Ashok the Indian boy.  Some of the `inner workings\' of Ashton got to be a bit tedious, and I found myself flipping through to get back to the story line.  Also, some of the battle scenes, as mentioned, were very detailed, and I admit that I skimmed those to get the gist of the battle.<br /><br />On the back of the novel that I read is a single quote that sums up the story, \"A great romantic adventure novel.\"  However, what I took from The Far Pavilions was the story of tolerance, and learned more about Afghanistan, which hasn\'t changed for centuries, to give me a greater understanding of what it is we face in today\'s world and the War on Terror.  This novel had shown, quite well, the problem with Afghanistan in that it is a very factioned, tribal country that is quite difficult to govern.  It was sad to see countless men perish in this country of 1879-1880.<br /><br />Here are a few quotes from the book that I loved.<br /><br />\"She is the other half of me.  Without her, I am not complete....she has all the courage in the world, yet at the same time she is like - like a quiet and beautiful room where one can take refuge from noise and storms and ugliness, and sit back and feel peaceful and happy and completely content: a room that will always be there and always the same...\"<br /><br />\"The mogul conquest of India and the Arab conquest of Spain, and all the many Holy Wars - the Jehads waged in the name of Allah - that have drenched the long centuries with blood.... The fact that religion had not brought love and brotherhood and peace to mankind, but, as was promised, a sword.\"<br /><br />\"We go in search of some place where we may live and work in peace, and where men do not kill or persecute each other for sport or at the bidding of Governments - or because others do not think or speak or pray as they do, or have skins of a different colour.\"<br /><br />After finishing this tome, I was asked by my daughter if I would recommend this book, and to whom, I couldn\'t answer her right away.  I know that several people before me, to include many writers, claim that this is their favourite book, or one that has greatly influenced them.  It is well written and very informative, and I am glad that I had finally found the courage to read such a novel, but I wouldn\'t say it is a favourite of mine, nor is it a book that I would recommend.  If someone wants to learn a bit more about India and Afghanistan and the British Raj, who doesn\'t mind long, detailed battle scenes, and a bit of a romance, than this is the book for them.  It was well-researched, as pointed out in the Author\'s Note at the end of the story, and how many things were true and accurate.  However, as I did feel the need to skim a portion of the book, I cannot put it in a `favourite\' or `recommend\' category.<br /><br />I gave this novel 4 stars because of the effort of this novel and how well it was written.  It was useful to this reader to understand better the country of Afghanistan (which has not changed much in its tribal conflicts within), and how the end of the novel seemed to speak to peace and tolerance, even though it was written in 1978.<br /><br />Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it. - George Santayana (There are many different translations of this quote.)',NULL,4),(249,189,'\"I lift up mine eyes unto the mountains from whence cometh my help.\"','The back cover blurb on my edition of The Far Pavilions compares it to Gone With the Wind, and there are many ways this is a fair comparison.  Most obviously, both novels are epic in length, with the Far Pavilions weighing in at over 900 pages in length.  But, The Far Pavilions is also epic in scope.<br /><br />Set mainly in India, the book follows Ashton, the son of British parents, who is born in India and raised there until the age of 11, for various reasons identifying himself as an Indian.  Then, he goes to Britian to finish his schooling and be \"civilized.\"  As a young man, he goes back with the British military to India.  He\'s neither Indian nor British, not fully able to identify with either, and not fully accepted by either.<br /><br />It is mainly through Ashton\'s eyes (and occasionally through those of his friends) that we learn about India during the mid-1800s, about the religious beliefs of the Hindus and Muslims, about the role of women, the practice of purdah and of suttee, the British military\'s actions in India and Afghanistan in this time, and much more.  But, we also follow Ashton\'s story, the story of a man who has a foot in both worlds, which at times gives him unique insights, but also leaves him with a shaky footing.<br /><br />In historical novels, I do like to know how much is truth and how much is fiction. By the dedication, one of the main characters in the latter part of the book was a real person.  How much of what we\'re told of him is fact?  Did the major events that Ash was involved in actually happen and how were they altered for the purposes of the story?  Unfortunately, there is no author\'s note making this plain.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed reading most of this book.  It did drone on a bit at times when sharing some historical-cultural information about India, but on the whole it was enjoyable and fascinating reading.  I felt that I learned much reading The Far Pavilions.  However, the book also worked as entertainment, as I enjoyed Ash\'s story.  I do have to say that much of the last third of the book was skimmed.  It focused very heavily on political-historical matters and less on cultural issues and less on Ashton personally, and so was of less interest to me.  But, it did become more interesting again to me at the end.<br /><br />This book does have a couple romances, one of which seems to be a hopeless one.  For those who, like me, read historical fiction, to learn about a time period and not to read a smutty romance novel, they will be pleased to know that the descriptions of Ashton\'s sexual encounters apart from his one true love are very brief and not at all explicit.  With his one true love, there is a relatively brief (1-2 pages) description of their first sexual intimacy, and 1-2 paragraphs of that is mildly explicit.  For the length of the book, I can handle that one occurence, and on the whole, the author handles sexual matters very tastefully.  The romances, however, are a minor focus of the book in general.  There are sections of the book where they take the main focus, but not by and large throughout the book.<br /><br />The religious views of the Hindus and Moslems are shared relatively matter-of-factly.  Ashton\'s religious views are an amalgram of those and Christianity and what just \"feels right\" to him.  I don\'t share his views, but they aren\'t portrayed in a way that the author is trying to impose them upon the reader.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to readers of historical fiction.  It was both educational and entertaining, with a story carried along by good writing rather than sensationalistic or smutty happenings.  I do feel, however, that this book could have been pared down from its roughly 950 pages to 700-800 pages, without hurting the narrative, and the book would have been much improved. I\'m glad to have read the book and will probably read it again someday, though less often than I would if it were a bit shorter in length. Hopefully, the epic length will not be too much of a deterrent to interested readers, as this is good historical fiction.

One day he was lucky, and found an advertisement about a dog hound selling dogs at a cheap price. To get his dream accomplished, he worked for 2 years making fifty dollars of money by selling the fishermen crawfish, minnows, and fresh vegetables; during the berry season, he can sell all the berries he picked at Grandpa\'s store. After Grandpa had ordered the dogs, it took weeks for the dogs to arrive at the station in town. Billy could not wait, so he decided to walk to the town himself which took over a day. When he got there, he noticed many things that he had never seen before, and was not used to what was done in town.<br /><br />The love and relationship between Billy, Little Ann, and Old Dan is portrayed really well, therefore, this book is a great book for readers who love dogs. The greatest part of the book, is when Billy tries really hard to accomplish his dream, and works harder than ever the get Little Ann and Old Dan. This shows how desperate Billy was to get a dog, and collecting his own money at his age is a really hard thing to do.<br /><br />He got Little Ann, the little girl dog, and Old Dan, his brave boy dog. Billy trains them to hunt coons by bringing them to the rivers near his house. They learned how to swim and find the trails of coons, and became excellent hunting hounds. Though the sizes of his dogs were small, but had wonderful powers on hunting that was only found on them. They could trace the weirdest coon trick that no other dog could, and had surprised many people in the novel. They participate in a tournament for coon hunting hounds, and choose the winner by the participant hunts the most coons with their dog\'s skills. If Old Dan and Little Ann were not the two dogs that Billy got, he would not have been very successful.

Billy and his family tie this story together. For Billy to get his dogs he has to walk miles, and miles to get them. For that walking to get them and have to bring them back in the dark that takes courage and bravery. As well the dogs and Billy go on the exciting hunting trips. That also takes a lot of courage and bravery.<br /><br />The characters in this story are Billy one of the most important, Little Ann and Old Dan are Billy\'s dogs that he bought. Billy\'s ma believes deeply in god. His father does too but he also works a lot also. Then we come to Billy\'s two little sisters, they\'re not a big part of the story not as much as Billy and his ma and pa and little Ann and old Dan.<br /><br />  Next you bring me to the setting were the story takes place.

Right the =n and there the young boy and his dogs knew something wasn\'t right.<br /><br />In Wichita, Oklahoma wilson Rawls wrote this very emotional, suspectful book.  This book is also an action fulfilled book.  \"Knowing that he was in trouble, Billy scurries into the woods careless.\"  Billy was a young hunter ready to take on any obstacle in his way.  His father and grandpa are very alik.  Thet6 are both hard workers and both don\'t stop until the job is finished.  HIs mother is very loving and careing.<br /><br />Throughout his book Rawls is very realistic.  He is emotional at times, but always interacts with a humerous or action fulfilled event.  He\'s not always stuck on one feelinged event he switches each and every time you read the next page.  \"Where the Red Fern Grows\" is a lot like \"Shiloh\" and \"Old Yeller.\"  Old Yeller, Shiloh, and Where the Red Fern Grows all have something to do with a boy and his dogs, and something bad happeninf to the both of them.  In all these books, the endings are different from each other, but they are all outstanding books to read. The author don;t exactly use a whole bunch of medaohors, but the authors style fits many of what his readers expected.<br /><br />While reading the book, I couldn\'t stop when I wanted to.  THere was so much going on and so many things happening too.  Once one thing ended another happened.  The book is very interesting and action filfilled.<br /><br />\"Where the Red Fern Grows\" is an action fulfilled book that all hunters and folks thata like books that keep you suspecting should read.  I advise you deeply to read \"Where the Red Fern Grows.\"  If you like this book than try \"Old Yeller\" and \"Shiloh.\"',NULL,4),(288,190,'This will tear your heart into pieces','What I liked about the plot of this story, and the main characters is that it teaches you to be thankful for what you have.  In this book Billy Coleman has always wanted a pair of fine hunting dogs, but his family and him could never really afford it. So for two years Billy works his butt off so he could finally get enough money to get those dogs.  When he gets the dogs he trains them, and teaches them how to hunt.  They even end up winning a big hunting tournament.  As Billy and his family are getting ready to move, he takes his dogs hunting one last time, and as they are hunting, they come across a mountain lion which tries to attack Billy.  But thankfully Billy\'s dog Old Dan runs across and saves him before the mountain lion can get him.  Old Dan suffers fatul wounds and ends up dying, and pretty soon his other dog Little Ann dies of starvation because she misses Old Dan so much. Billy really loves his dogs, and goes to see their graves one more time before they move, and he spots red ferns growing on them which is a sign angels are with them. I thought Billy was a great kid who was really caring, and kind.  His parents were also really helpful because they supported him for everything he did. This is a great family book, and you will enjoy reading it.<br /><br />For this project I myself think I could have done a little better.  For example, I should have tried to find better pictures for my kids book.  I thought they were sloppy, and a little crooked, this would help out for the neatness of my rubric score.  Another thing I could have done for my presentation is try to be more enthusiastic, I probably bored people in their seats with my monotone voice.  But overall this is what I think I need to improve on.<br /><br />The kind of student that I would recommend this book to is a person who likes, and enjoys animals.  I think they\'d enjoy this because it deals with a 10 year old kids love, and happiness between him and his dogs.  I would also recommend this book to a student who likes hunting.  This book is mostly about hunting coons, and it even states in the book how to catch a coon.  You\'ll love this if your trying to learn how to catch a coon.  These are the type of students that I would recommend this book to.',NULL,4),(289,190,'A Story of Man\'s Best Friend','I\'m in sixth grade and I have watched a lot of movies, but Where The Red Fern grows is by far one of my favorites.<br /> It was about this boy and he has two dogs Dan and Ann.

Dan gets injured on his stomach and dies. Then after a few days Ann dies of loneliness. They bury them side by side and then in the middle of them a red fern starts growing.<br /> I loved the movie another thing I loved was the acting. There wasn\'t that many special effects. The actors made everything look real this boy fell and they made it look like the boy was really injured. The acting was astonishing.<br />  Like I said before there really wasn\'t that many special effects, but the scenes were filmed in beautiful places. They were mostly filmed outdoors in the mountains and woods, but you have to see it to know how beautiful it was.<br />  You really need to see this movie just once. I know how some people don\'t like watching movies with things dyeing in them in this case dogs, but this movie proves how much you can love something. In one scene it shows u how to use teamwork.

I have only reviewed a few movies before, \"Where the Red Fern Grows\", but you\'ve got to start somewhere! \"Where the Red Fern Grows\" is one of my all time favorite movies. I have seen the movie and read the book several times, so this has given me a lot of time to think about this film.<br />This movie is about a young boy and the love he has for his dogs, and the love that they have for him and each other. Billy and his dogs have a relationship that seems only separable by death, and when death happens, he and his family realize that it is all part of God\'s plans to answer their prayers.<br />This movie was made in 1991, so there weren\'t many special effects, but the characters made it seem like it wasn\'t a movie at all, but a part of their own lives. When they cried, when the dogs hunted, fought, and died, it all seemed so real. In fact, I wanted to write a letter to the Coleman family to see how their life in town was going! Yeah, it seemed that real!<br />This film manages to make me shed a tear and build up a smile every time I watch it. It is a heartfelt story that teaches you about love, faith, and hope. After I watched it, I felt the need to hug a dog!<br />So, like I said at the beginning, this is one of my all time favorite movies.

When my teacher told me we were going to watch Where the Red Fern Grows, I thought this is an old movie, and it is probably boring. I also thought it was going to be bad. I was very, very wrong!<br /> In Where the Red Fern Grows the boy has wanted a dog for almost his whole life. He wanted them so bad that it made him hurt inside. It made him feel like it was chewing his heart out. There I s one problem though, the dogs cost a lot of money. The boy\'s family lives on a farm, and they are not the richest family around. The boy really wants the dogs though. What will he do to get them?<br /> The film showed lots of love in it and that made it wonderful. It showed how much the boy cared for the dogs. It also showed how much heart the boy had. It also showed how all the members in the family cared about each other.<br /> In the movie, the dogs have lots of things to do. I know how hard it is to train dogs to do stuff, and it also takes a lot of time. The dogs did wonderful, everything was perfect. It was amazing how the dogs did when the boy was training them. Another thing they did that was great was when the boy would be talking to his dad or someone the dogs would just sit down and stay. They would not get up and run away. Also the dogs did a great job when they fought the mountain lion. One thing that really touched my heart was when one dog stood up and laid down on the dead dog\'s pile of dirt.<br />  The movie was wonderful it showed lots of love and stuff about the Lord. I can\'t wait to watch it again. If you have never seen it you definitely need to watch it.',NULL,5),(292,190,'Classic story to read and reread','My name is Carrie, and I love the book because its about a boy that is walking down  the street and helps a hound .The hound he helps was in a dog fight with lots of dogs ganging the one dog. When he lets the dog go free, he decides he wants two hunting hounds of his own so he can keep them. He begs, begs, and begs his parents, but they continue to say NO! When he is outside in the woods he finds an ad in a magazine for two hound dogs. It says that they are only 25 dollars for one. He wants two so he makes 50 dollars in two years. He takes the money to his grandpa\'s store so his grandpa can order them. It takes like two weeks for them to arrive at the animal shelter. There is no way he can get them by mail so he has to go to town by himself to get them. He sets off at night and doesn\'t return until a few days later. When he does return he has gifts for every one.  When he brings home his pups he tries to catch a coon to train them. He can\'t catch a coon because they are too smart. His papa shows him a way, and he finally catches one. He trains his dogs and takes them to a hunting competition. They win and the next day at home he goes down to their field and hunts them. It was dark and Billy did not know there was a mountain lion. His dogs thought it was a coon so they attacked. The mountain lion killed them and the next day he buried them. The day after that he goes to say goodbye because they were moving. When he got there a red fern had grown. Then when Billy was little his mom told him an old folk tale that when something dies that you really love a red fern would grow. So what do you think of it?

When i read this I was hooked. I just HAD to stay up to 11:00 p.m. to finish it. True, I was dissapointed that the story ended so short, taht when one dog died the other dog just gave up and died. The story also had a lot of racoon hunts, which I don\'t really like because I am an animal lover. Tose hunts didn\'t hold my attention for long at all. Here are some pros and cons of this story.<br />Pros:<br />First seven chapters hold you, and then your too hooked to stop reading.<br />You can relate with the age and having to be patient.<br />It teaches you about things you would have never thought about before you read that book.<br />Cons:<br />The book starts getting boring in the racoon hunts and starts losing your intrest.<br />It takes a long time to get the story started, and then its not really worth the wait.<br />A lot of unimportant details are added in this book.<br />To all those who cry about dead things, I would not recamend this book. Some one else dies a \"tragic\" death besides the dogs. *ahem* \'bully\'.

This book provokes one\'s own memories, in a simple yet frankly down home style that warms the heart and  stirs the soul. The main character, Billy, is presented in a confiding way.  He is tenacious, perseverant, and self-reliant. Anything he receives in  life is not handed to him; in the spirit of his forefathers, he works for  every material thing ever needed. He is consistent with the times and  geographic location. This fact is apparent both stylistically and in  Billy\'s developed idiosyncrasies. Use of the pronoun \"I\" adds interest and  realism to the context, giving the illusion of Billy actually recollecting  and delivering the story. He reasons in a way that would be typical of a  boy his age, uses amusing Southern phrases that fit his cultural  upbringing, and is acute in detail, as though clearly remembering noted  incidents. Uncommon expressions such as \"Old Dan bawled treed\" or \"the  grinning Ozark moon\" with misuse of the King\'s English, (that is, incorrect  verb tenses, and use of the slang term \"ain\'t\") are characteristic of the  setting. Narration in the first person is attentive to use of trifling  details. Earthy, picturesque descriptions fill the reader\'s mind, with  abundant adjectives. One can almost feel the hot sun in one scene, or the  tension as some hunting tale climaxes in another.  The author of the book,  Wilson Rawls, is optimistic about life. His writing reflects pleasant  adolescent memories, proudly recalled. The feeling is upbeat; the story is  positive, despite mishaps and obstacles without which it would appear  contrived.  Though not sappy or overdone, only bittersweet, its simple  hunting adventures are tainted with unabashed poignancy. Everyone achieves  what it is he desires through patience and hard work. It is a homespun  sentiment of Americana, a fulfillment of the American Dream.',NULL,5),(296,190,'sloppy firsts','I liked this book because it showed how Billy and his dogs relationship grew throughout the story. Their love and respect grew to the point where they were willing to risk their lives for each other. Billy\'s parents also helped him through the tough times. They supported him and tried to help him forget horrible things that happened. This book shows that if you are determined, like Billy,you can actually make what you really want come true, just like how Billy got his hounds.I think after Billy saw the sacred red fern by his little dogs graves, he realized that his parents were right about what they said about God. I think that the sacred red fern was planted on Old Dan and Little Ann\'s graves because he was trying to apoligize to Billy for making him suffer so much. He therefore, was making Old Dan and Little Ann\'s graves a sacred spot forever. They were safe forever. Billy, Old Dan, and Little Ann\'s relationship was also very equal. When Little Ann was almost dead in the freezing river, Billy found a way to save her while have the risk of dieing himself. Also when Billy was almost being killed by the mountain lion, they jumped in between them and risked their little lives for his. And when Billy saved Old Dan from all those fights with coons and cats, he saved him for those coons could have ripped Old Dan apart.These were definitely three of the closest friend I\'ve ever seen or read about, even if it is between a human and animals, they still understand each other and respect other.I loved this book.

Billy wants nothing more than to have two hounds that he can hunt for raccoons with. Billy’s only problem is that his family isn’t very well off and can’t afford a hound. However, Billy’s determination and passion for dogs outweighs his financial struggles. After three months he is able to purchase two red hounds for forty dollars. The first night that Billy had the dogs, he stayed in the woods because he couldn’t make it back from Tahlequah (where the dogs were held for pick up) in one night. That night, Billy encountered a Mountain Lion. However, Billy was able to build up a fire to keep the Mountain Lion away. The next day is when major training started for “Little Ann” and “Old Dan.” Over time, Billy’s hounds proved extremely valuable. In fact, Billy’s grandfather thought that the hounds were so splendid, that he entered them into a national raccoon hunting competition. This is when the great adventure of the story beings.<br />I feel like this novel was written especially for me because I strongly related to Billy. I believe I related to him because Billy is a very hard worker and is extremely caring to those he loves. Also, Billy tries to please everybody throughout the novel, as do I in my life. In summary, I loved the book, I was always interested while reading it. In fact, my favorite part of the book was when Billy brought the hounds home and showed his family. I loved the surprised and excited look on all of their faces. I do however, have a least favorite part of the book that I will not disclose. With that being said, I wish I could change the ending of the book. Overall, Where The Red Fern Grows is the best book that I have ever read. I love how Wilson Rawls mixes various themes into one novel.<br />If I were given the option, I (without a doubt) recommend this book to someone. I believe that a junior high student or even a grown adult can take something from this book, as I did. I believe that a person who values animals and love would enjoy this book as much as I have.',NULL,5),(310,190,'Heartwarming and Real:  This book bred my love for words','Hi, I\'m going to tell you about one of my favorite books. The book is called Where The Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls. It\'s a fabulous book, and I\'m going to tell you a little bit about it. It\'s about a boy named Billy. Billy wants to buy two hunting dogs so he can hunt by himself. He has to recycle cans to be able to afford to get the dogs. When he gets all the money that he needs, he has to walk to the guy\'s house to pay for the dogs, and then he gets to bring the dogs home. He bought a girl dog and a boy dog. He named them Little Anne and Old Dan. Billy grew very attached to the dogs. One day when Billy and the dogs went hunting, Old Dan got into a really bad situation. The dogs were looking for a raccoon and they ran into a Mountain Lion. The Mountain Lion attacked Old Dan. When Billy got Old Dan home, his mama put a wrapping around his sides so the wounds would heal up. Billy\'s mother knew the dog wouldn\'t live. Unfortunately Old Dan didn\'t make it, and Billy felt as if he lost his best friend. They could tell Little Anne knew her brother wasn\'t there anymore because Little Anne wouldn\'t eat or sleep. They finally got her eat, but Little Anne passed away one afternoon. Billy was torn up inside because now he lost two of his best friends and his favorite hunting dogs ever.

I have an old paperback copy somewhere, but I couldn\'t find it if my life depended on it.<br /><br />It involves the \"senseless\" killing of \'coons and the \"senseless\" chopping down of trees. But it\'s set in a different time and different place, where these things are not out of the norm. For an animal lover like me, I had no problem.

Billy wanted to be a coon hunter and he needed a dog for one. Billy saved money for years collecting little by little to buy two dogs. Those two dog were on sale in the city. Billy, of course, lives in the country. Billy buys his two dogs and trains them. After about 2 years, Billy was about the greatest coon hunter in the Ozarks. The girl dog\'s name is Little Ann and the boy dog\'s name is Old Dan. When Billy was looking for coons, they had encountered a mountain lion. Old Dan was brave and Little Ann was smart. Together they killed the mountain lion but were severely damaged. Old Dan died from loss of blood. Little Ann basically committed suicide because she wouldn\'t eat and died.<br /><br />I think this book was a good book and shows what love is. You can\'t express love, but if you read this book, you\'ll know what it is. Billy is probably about the age of 14 when his dogs died. I personally couldn\'t put this book down until I got too tired. Even though it\'s kind of cheesy, it is a good book.<br /><br />I encourage my sister to read this book but she says it is too hard. Actually, if you read this book, it doesn\'t seem too long. That is because you\'d want to read more and more and more. I encourage you to read this book because it helps you to understand what happens in life.<br /><br />There are two quotes in this book Love and friendship. Billy loved his dog more than anything in the world. He\'d give up anything just to keep them safe and happy. Also Little Ann and Old Dan were the best friends. This shows friendship because Little Ann didn\'t eat since Old Dan died.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was when Old Dan, Little Ann were fighting the mountain lion. It kept my heart pounding and I didn\'t want to put the book down.

It expresses deep love for dogs and a strong relationship between the dogs that led to their doom but also helped them a lot. Recently I saw the 2004 movie version of this book. It nailed all the little concepts like giving each person in his family a gift and how both his dogs went to a better place, but they didn\'t show how close he were to his dogs and how his dogs were close to each other.<br /><br /> Other than missing the deep relationship, it was pretty good because it caught the events in the story such as bullies pulling his dogs\' ears, seeing Dan and Ann in a tree, and training the dogs as soon as possible. These types of things from the story are what make it like the book. In the book and movie there was this big scene where the dogs tree their first coon and it happened to be the biggest tree. They missed a few other things.<br /><br /> In the competition, there was suppose to be a beauty competition that little Ann was supposed to win. There was no beauty contest so she didn\'t win anything. They said in the book that little Ann was smaller and smarter than old Dan but in the movie they looked the same. The most important difference is that of the relationship. Like I said before, that\'s what makes the book so heart breaking and the movie dull. There was also all those times that were sad in the movie, not that there were a lot, no one cried. The end was kind of cheesy because of no one being emotional.

He set a goal to get enough money to buy his hound dogs and he accomplished it.  Another goal he set was to win the gold cup in the hunting tournament and he did win it.  That is why my second favorite character is Billy.<br />  My favorite part in the book is in chapter 5 when Billy went to Tahlequah, Kentucky to get his hound dogs.  He was so surprised and exicited to see them.  When he did see them, he sort of froze and couldn\'t move.  I don\'t think I would have froze if that were me, I think I would have just been very happy.<br />  I think this book was sort of good to read.

It was nostalgic to some extent, but I was a little disappointed.  Billy seemed like an overly sensitive kid who cried a lot, and he showed no compunction in cutting down beautiful trees so he could kill a trapped animal, although he could also be resourceful and courageous at times.  I also thought the story was a little slow in developing.  It was sad for Billy to see his two dogs die after fighting with the mountain lion, but the dogs were the ones who initiated the contact, ultimately receiving the same treatment they had  been harshly dealing out to raccoons for quite some time, so I felt no pity for them.

I enjoy relationships between dogs and their people - but I\'m also a vegetarian based on humaneness and can\'t appreciate the symbiotic partnership between a hunter and his trained dogs. I enjoy hearing about other lifestyles which give me a glimpse into another world and how people experience life differently than me - but this one brought a little too much baggage with it because I\'m old enough to have seen some of that backwoods, so-called simple rural community living ... and the picture painted of poverty in the beautiful Ozarks is painted a little too positively for what I\'ve experienced.<br />Also, I have seen dogs go predator and ruthlessly worry a smaller animal to its death. It\'s not pretty. I\'ve heard animals scream in terror when cornered and I\'ve seen animals skinned. There\'s a lot not shared in the author\'s casual, &#34;and then we skinned them.&#34;<br />I\'ve seen the disregard of basic life and the sense of entitlement and superiority many hunters bring to a hunt. I rejected it as a sport or necessity more years ago than I can count.<br />Nonetheless, my daughter read this book when younger and adored it so I decided to finally read it myself. I wanted to just go with the flow and find the charm she\'d fallen in love with.<br />The plot is simple as is the writing. It is thinly plotted but with scenes and references people enjoy reading much symbolism into. (Faith, perserverance, loyalty.) And it was surprisingly spiritual - this was a family who credited God with everything good that happened to them and blamed themselves when things went wrong. That alone kind of spoiled plot elements for me that other readers apparently found inspirational.<br />Factually speaking the boy did what he had to do to get the dogs he so wanted. The life he lived, both with and without the dogs, was simply life as it was in those times and in that place. Many of the characters were very authentic - except for his parents who simply did not act consistently like country folks, or perhaps I should say parents.<br />I can\'t dislike this book for what it is any more than I could or should dislike another book because I don\'t care for the story it\'s telling. I wouldn\'t have allowed my child to read it if I\'d understood all that was in it and yet, surprise! She\'s the one who loved it as a voracious young reader and still remembers it with fondness, even as a vegetarian, animal rights believing agnostic teenager. All she got from it was how much the dogs loved  their boy... as our dogs have always loved her.

When he does get them, he does not just use them for himself he helps others and especially his family.

But, I picked up this book, and I\'m glad I did.<br /><br />Where the Red Fern Grows is about a 11 year old boy, who really wants 2 hunting dogs. Coon hunting dogs, to be exact. The boy, Billy, works EXTREMELY hard for it, and in two years, is the proud owner of two beautiful dogs. The story follows him to when he is about 14 or 15, and the book shows how far as a person Billy has come.<br /><br />This story will bring laughter and tears, and I am happy to report, has a great deal of character development. You get very close to Billy, and when tragedies happen, you can\'t help but cry with him. The dogs have amazing character, too. \'Old Dan\' is a grumpy and real hunting dog. I say real, because his partner in crime, \'Little Ann\' is almost unidentifiable as a hunting dog. She is tiny, \'a registered midget\', and loves to hop around and play, like a puppy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This book is AMAZING, and a recommended read. I would not suggest it to children under 12, as there is a lot of deep thinking that maybe cannot be comprehended yet. (There is also a fair amount of scariness in the book.) All in all, everyone has to read this book!',NULL,5),(366,190,'Best book from Wilison Rawls!!','\"Where the Red Fern Grows\"<br />By Wilson Rawls<br />Would you do anything to get a dog?  Billy in \"Where the Red Fern Grows,\" asks his parents if they will buy him one, but they refuse.  He secretly catches \"coons\" (raccoons) and sells their hides until he has enough to buy two good hounds.<br /> The two dogs and Billy have many adventures.  The book makes you feel as if you are really there.  When the clever dogs tree a \"coon\" you can literally hear the baying of the hounds and the whines of the trapped raccoon.<br /> Billy would make a good role model for any boy.  He\'s brave even when he is faced with the most extreme danger of the whole valley, a mountain lion!  When he hunts he combines determination with smarts to catch his \"coons.\"  He stays happy even when times are hard.  \"Where the Red Fern Grows\" has some tough words so I recommend it for readers ten and up.

Before you watch the movie, I recommend that you read the book first because the book has more detail and the movie cut out a scene or two, but it\'s still pretty good. Even though I personally like movies better than books, I have to say the book was a bit better than the movie.<br /><br />The movie is great and it has great actors and is a lot like the book, but it\'s missing some parts. For example, they totally cut the scene where Little Ann falls into the river when they are hunting and when he was getting the dogs, he rode a pipe just like the school kids. They also left out some major parts such as, the dogs don\'t seem as close to each other and took out a little of Billy\'s character because he doesn\'t seem as close to the dogs as he is in the book.<br /><br />The movie doesn\'t show all the details, but, hey you can\'t expect it to have everything in it, can you?<br /><br />By: Sara Jan',NULL,3),(368,190,'A heartwarming story','Where The Red Fern Grows was a very good book.

Made in 1974, there are evident signs of the age of the film, but this works to its advantage.  This is one of the classics.  Perhaps not as famous as Old Yeller, it\'s \"older brother\", which also hailed from the Disney studio\'s, it is equally as likeable.<br />Stewart Petersen does a terrific job as young Billy Coleman, and makes the character immensely likeable.<br />The film follows Billy\'s life, as he desperately saves money to buy a pair of hunting dogs.  It is evident that he leads a fairly poor, but honest life, and struggles with his decision to buy the dogs, as opposed to giving the money to his Father.  On going to collect the dogs, he is stared at by the local folk, almost looked down upon, each one in turn glancing at this scruffy, barefoot young character as he enters \"their world\".  Picked on by local children, he befriends the local sheriff, who we meet again later in the film.<br />There are some wonderful scenes, from his first encounter with his new found friends, as they lick his toes, and he gently picks them up for the first time, to the comical scene where he is training them, and they run, followed by three children, through the house, sliding every which way on their Mothers freshly cleaned kitchen floor, in a scene which borders farcical, but knows where to draw the line, in keeping the humour gentle.<br />Billy is an idealistic young man, willing to take a beating and defy his mother, rather than break a promise to his dogs.  All this makes him a very likeable, and identifiable character.  This is further showed toward the end of the film, when his true courage and sportsmanship show themselves in a hunting competition.<br />This is by no means a jolly film - it\'s a positive tearjerker, unashamedly so.  There is a death, which in itself is only mildly instrumental to the plot, but serves Billy a valuable life lesson, and the viewer is left feeling his pain and sorrow.<br />The end is equally sad, which I won\'t give away, but there is a beautiful closing shot as the camera pans away from the family, focusing on a single red fern....<br />There are times when deep, clever plots, and intense dialogue serve no purpose, and this film is a shining example of this.  It has no pretences about what it is.  It is a lesson that true beauty is found in the simplicity and innocence of a child\'s world.<br />It is quite simply, a nice film.  I am not fond of the word \"nice\", but in this instance it serves well to describe the film.  A great example that some of the older films, can still give modern Hollywood movies a run for their money.  This does just that, and wins hands down all the way.<br />Particular mention must also be made to the soundtrack, which is perfect for the film, and simply beautiful, from the gentle incidental music, to the lyrics in every song.  I watched this anticipating it to be a little \"ropey\", and perhaps rough around the edges, given it is 30 years old. That anticipation was the only thing the film wasn\'t.  It really is a polished gem of a movie, and one that I can recommend very highly.  Sure it\'s a sappy, sentimental tearjerker - it doesn\'t pretend to be anything else, and for that, I loved it.

This story expresses the love between a boy and his hounds. The boy would do anything for his hounds as well as his hounds would do for him. They had much loyalty.

Huynh<br />Period: 1<br />Where the Red Fern Grows is an amazing book. It\'s about Billy, and how he tried everything he would to get something he really wanted, two coon hounds. In the beginning, he asked his parents many times to see if he could have not one, but two hound dogs. Everyday, he would just get the same answer, \"Maybe some day when we can afford it, you can have them, but not right now.\" When Billy one day finally earns enough money to buy his two coon hunting hounds, he named them Old Dan and Little Ann. He taught them how to hunt for coons, how to work together, and to be friendly because that is what hounds are.<br /> What I like about the book is how the two dogs wouldn\'t go hunting with any other person except Billy. When Billy goes hunting with Old Dan and Little Ann, he never would let them down. One time, Billy even promised to cut a very thick tree if his hounds would get the coon for him. \"He seemed to be saying, `You told us to put one in a tree and you would do the rest.\" Billy saw the hound\'s eyes and he was willing to cut the tree down even if it takes him a whole year.<br /> Another part that I like about the book is how Old Dan and Little Ann seems to work and help each other out. When Old Dan gets a wound or cut, Little Ann would lick his wounds to heal it and then Old Dan does the same back. During coon hunting, Old Dan would take hold of the coon and Little Ann would then dart in. \"Little Ann had not made it. Old Dan, seeing the fate of his little friend, had quit the chase and come back to help her.\" Old Dan tried hollering so that Billy would come over to save Little Ann. Without the Old Dan and Little Ann getting along, they wouldn\'t be able to catch any coons.<br /> My least favorite part of the book was when Billy made a bet with the Pritchards. The bet was about the Rubins getting the two dollars if Billy loses. I dislike this part because the dogs might get hurt because Rubin and Rainie are people who always mess around. At the end, Billy finds out that he had gotten into a lot of trouble. He even lost his two dollars even if he won. Even though this was an important part of the story, in general, I think Where the Red Fern Grows is a very superior book to read.

This is the fourth time I read this book and I think you would love it too.<br /> I thought it was funny when Billy got his pups.  He couldn\'t move or speak.  He was so happy!  On the other hand, I thought it was sad when they were out hunting and they found a mountain lion.  When the dogs tried to kill it, it hurt the dogs so much.  When they returned home, Old Dan died and shortly after, Little Ann died too.<br /> I would also recommend Rawls\' Summer of the Monkeys.  Both books flow awesomely.  Back to Where the Red Fern Grows ... basically the first hunt was all determination.  Farther in, the hunts showed bravery.  There was friendship and love between the 2 dogs and the boy.  Little Ann felt compassion for the Old Dan when he died, so she died of a broken, longing heart.<br /> My favorite part was when the Grandpa went on the coon hunting competition and the look on his face when they won the competition.<br /> I would recommend this book for any child who can read independently, or any little child with good attention.  The book is timeless for any child from 3 to 103+!  My mom first read it to me when I was 3 and again when I was 5; then I read it when I was 6 and now I\'m 7½ and I am reading it again.

I will definitely consult this next time I travel as I plan my trip- HOWEVER, I would research a place and take with me a more detailed country specific guide (like Let\'s Go or Rick Steves) when actually travelling for other sites, hostel/hotel and food suggestions.<br />Secondly, as others have mentioned she spends WAY too much precious space on the US (if you\'re going to skip whole countries, it\'s probably ok to skip a few states).<br />Thirdly, yes, the spas/hotels/restaurants should only have been an add on to the sites, not entries in and of themselves!

I don\'t blame her for the ommissions (even though I was shocked -as everyone else probably is- to see my own top choices not in the book).  I understand it\'s a subjective list of her own choices.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I\'m going to use this note to add my suggestions: I would suggest that if you\'re ever in Poland, you visit the Auschwitz/Birkenau concentration camps.  They are amazing, kept by the gov\'t so it has not been turned into a commercial tourist trap, but merely a place to learn about our history.

It includes experiences like bungee jumping from the Kawarau Bridge in New Zealand, playing golf in Scotland, and attending the opera at La Scala in Milan. There is a useful set of special indices to help you find active adventures, festivals, spiritual sites, museums, natural wonders, culinary experiences, resorts, beaches, museums, and sacred places around the world.<br />This is not really a Fodor\'s-type travel guide. Although it lists some places to stay and dine, it should be regarded as a source of ideas and suggestions. You should consult more detailed travel guides when planning your trip. Even if you don\'t have the time or resources to experience some of these destinations, it\'s a great way to armchair travel to some spectacular places off the beaten track. Bon voyage!<br />Eileen Rieback',NULL,4),(441,191,'Too many hotels and not enough places','This book is suited for easy reading in the powder room or waiting room; a book to be opened at random or for a quick review of some interesting places in the world.<br /><br />However, it is not suited for the traveler (who will demand more), nor (I think) for anyone who really wants to see the 1,000 best places in the world.  This book lists many such places, but misses as many, and substitutes some odd choices instead.  It combines beautiful places with hot new fashion spots, in an odd sort of way that may satisfy some readers more than others.  In short, it is a cute book, but neither timeless nor valuable.<br /><br />Some sections (California and Egypt, for example) are good.  Others are very idiosyncratic (restaurants in Chicago? Spas in Arizona?) or incomplete (Massachuetts, Myanmar, New Zealand).<br /><br />Speaking personally, I would hope that Chicago has more to offer than a few restaurants and a tour of Frank Lloyd Wright homes.  If not, I would have saved the ink for other, more memorable places.  It seems odd to me to rank Boulders Resort or Canyon Health Resort in Arizona as the equals of Sedona, Canyon de Chelly, or Grand Canyon.  I think most people could die happily without seeing these particular spas or restaurants.<br /><br />Although everyone has different taste, I felt some real gems were missing.  Discussing Tanglewood is fine, but what about the Norman Rockwell Museum only six miles down the road in Stockbridge.  Freedom Trail, Boston, is nice too -- but so are Concord an Lexington.  What about Pagan in Burma - only the largest collection of temples on earth and one of the wonders of the modern world?  Tsukiji Fish Market and Hyatt Hotel in Toyko, but not Nikko?  Where is mention of Great Barrier Island, the Hokianga or Arthur\'s Pass in New Zealand? The Four Seasons Hotel in Hamburg, but not the Raperbahn, or the Fischmarkt?  The list of missing wonders is long, and the author\'s choices of what to include and what to exclude was a bit exasperating to me.<br /><br />I had the feeling that Ms. Schultz did not visit many of the places she writes about, but wrote this book based on some quick desk research.  Otherwise, she would realize the difference between Mt. Kenya (a must see with its jungles, tundra, wildlife, glaciers and raw rock formations) and Mt. Kilimanjaro (a ho-hum slog up a dusty mound).  She would have included the Galapagos Islands (rather than simply listing most of the Hawaiian Islands) and might have thought twice about listing eight spots in Fiji and only two in Cambodia.  And she would have given London and Vienna a longer, deeper look.<br /><br />The book deserves to do well.  It is a brave start for people who love arbitrary lists.  However, some people would be happier, I think, with a book that is either a list of beautiful places or a book of fashionable hotels, spas and restaurants.  Some readers may be distressed at seeing the Pyramids of Giza in the same category as the Iowa State Fair.  Others will find the juxtaposition quite charming.',NULL,3),(442,191,'Broad, but shallow','This is an extraordinary wish list of faraway places, as well as a guide to the travel treasures in your own neck of the woods.  Patricia Schultz has been everywhere and seen everything, or so it seems.  What she has seen, she has recorded in a handy one-volume guide to the most remarkable corners of this world as we know it.<br /><br />Any book of this kind is of course subjective, but the well-traveled reader will find most of her or his favorite haunts herein.  This is of course a bit of a concern if you wanted to keep such out of the way joys as dinner at  Almo e Nadia in Milan all to yourself.  No matter, Schultz writes for the discerning and discriminating traveler, or armchair dreamer.  And she does not disappoint.<br /><br />The book is divided nicely into continents, with Europe at the fore.  But Schultz does not stint in her attention to Africa, The Middle East, Asia, Australia and environs, North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean.  If you have been there and done that, her book is a good reminder of the joys and wonders you have seen.  If not, this is a marvelous carrot dangling before all who love the lure of places yet unseen.<br /><br />Each locale has, as well as a description of the sites not to be missed, some good recommendations for dining and lodging.  Those who travel on a budget will be challenged by the rather opulent hotels Ms. Schultz suggests, but then again, a careful traveler will find a way to take in at least the occasional splurge, prompted by this guidebook.<br /><br />Do not look for lavish color photographs here.  All of the many photos are in black and white.  but do look for clues to such wide-ranging wanderlust as horseback riding in Mongolia, the Spa of all Spas, the Last Supper, the Albuquerque Balloon Festival.<br /><br />You will find yourself making little check marks beside all the places you\'ve gone, and exclamation points alongside those that are next on your list.<br /><br />If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.',NULL,5),(443,191,'500 destinations + 500 hotels','I have visited many of the places listed in this book, but to list the Grand Hotel Excelsior in Sorrento, and not mention the archeological museum in Naples, or even Herculaneum made me wonder if the author had really visited Campania.  The Grand Hotel Excelsior in Sorrento is beautiful, and I have stayed there in a suite with a view of the Bay of Naples, but the experiences that were the most memorable for me seem to have either been forgotten, or unknown by the author.  The same is true of Lake Como, and the Villa d\'Este even though it was one of the finest hotels that I have ever stayed in.  The hotel is fabulous, but I will never forget riding the ferry from village to village on beautiful Lake Como.  The Grand Hotel et des Iles Borromees is very grand, but the real treasures here are the three magnificent Islands of Lake Maggiore.  It would be a shame for someone to read this book, and decide not to visit some of the world\'s great sites, because they felt they could not afford the hotel, or restaurant that is touted. Also, some of the hotels that are listed are no longer the grand hotels she describes.  I would skip the Oriental in Bangkok, but the magnificent temples, and floating market are not to be missed.',NULL,1),(444,191,'1000 places that PAID to be listed?!?!?!','The value of a book like this is to whet your appetite to do more research to confirm this is a location you would like to visit.

I found very good descriptions for most places I am familiar with. Russia is excellent. I am in absolute agreement with the sections on London, Paris, Milan, Venice, Austria, Uzbekistan, New Zealand, Cook Islands, Fiji, Costa Rica, Belize, Canada, and the highlights in the US.<br /><br />Criticism: Germany is missing too many places that rightly qualify, such as, Coburg and Passau.

I saw \"1,000 Places to See Before You Die\" at a bookstore and took a copy with me to browse through over a cup of coffee. It was one of the bookstores that allows browsing over beverages. After 2 cups of java I left with the book - purchased, of course. And then I began reading, enjoying thoroughly and adding to my rapidly growing list of \"places to visit.\" Some of these places I will only know from my armchair, but the author\'s wonderfully descriptive vignettes, detailed indexes and marvelous photographs are the next best thing to being there. And one also avoids bankruptcy this way.<br /><br />This amazing travel anthology includes 1000 man-made and natural wonders of the world, thus the book\'s title. Ms. Schultz has done her research thoroughly in order to guide the would-be world explorers without losing them. And this is one of the most user-friendly guides I have seen. A detailed and cross-referenced, subject-specific index lists such categories as Unrivaled Museums, Sacred Places, Festivals, Culinary Experiences, and gorgeous beaches - also, addresses, phone and fax numbers, web sites, costs, best times to visit.<br /><br />From Europe to Africa to Asia - to your wildest dreams, Patricia Schultz has selected the most extraordinary places which reflect \"some sense of the earth\'s magic, integrity, wonder, and legacy.\" The author\'s prose is as exciting as the sites she describes. And she discusses why each of her entries is worthy of your itinerary. Take a safari into Botswana\'s Okavango Delta, tour the covered souks of Aleppo, climb the Tuscan hills to San Gimignano, sail the seven seas with descriptions of exactly what to look for in each. Visit Tokyo\'s Tsukiji Fish Market, the Great Wall of China, Brazil\'s Ipanema beach, the Buddhas of Borobudur, Mesa Verde\'s cave dwellings, the Oaxaca Saturday market, Canyon de Chelly, the backwaters of Kerala, California\'s Monterey Peninsula, the Lewis and Clark Trail in Oregon, Alaska\'s Inside Passage, and the Alhambra in Andalusia. Splurge, just once, at Venice\'s Cipriani Hotel, the Hassler in Rome, or Paris\'s Crillon.<br /><br />Although one needs a \"certain amount\" of money to actually take these trips, there is information for every class of travel and accommodation - from the most elite to the most acceptably modest.

I\'ve given this book twice already as a gift and will no doubt give it again and again.

Perhaps that is what some people want, but they might be better listed in a different type of book such as \'How to Spend a Fortune While Traveling\'.<br /><br />It certainly contains many of the obvious places that anyone would include in a list like this such as:  The Great Pyramids of Giza, The Okavango Delta, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Victoria Falls, Stonehenge, The Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, The Outer Banks, and numerous others.  There certainly are a great many fantastic sites listed.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is only a passing reference to Kruger National Park (which should be on anyone\'s list), and no mention of some great spots like the Columbia River Gorge or Powell\'s Books in Portland (perhaps the greatest books store on the planet).<br /><br />I can even see including some hotels in a book like this such as the Raffles in Singapore.  One could even see including a really unusual one like the Old Faithful Inn at Yellowstone or The Prince of Wales at Waterton Natl. Park in Alberta.  There is a passing reference to the Old Faithful Inn, but it doesn\'t have its own entry like many of the places that were included that are probably far less interesting and certainly far more expensive.<br /><br />This book is worthwhile to own to brainstorm a great trip.

I went to San Diego recently and I can tell you that the \"del Coronado\" hotel was not one of the places I wanted to see. I did rent a car from Hertz at the del Coronado, so I stepped inside to see why it was in this book. It was extravigant to be sure, but it was not really a place I had to see before I die!<br /><br />What do I consider a place that I have to see before I die? I look for natural beauty, cultural or historical significance. I didn\'t see in the book, for instance:<br /><br />1. Temecula Valley which is just north of San Diego. It is a beautiful area known for it\'s wineries AND was picked as one of the top places to retire in the United States!<br /><br />OR<br /><br />2. Balboa Park in San Diego, which contains the San Diego Zoo as well as Arts Centers and Museums. I saw the play \"Who\'s Afraid Of Virginia Wolff?\" at the Old Globe Theater, A theater in the round that is only three to four rows deep. It was a marvelous viewing experience.<br /><br />I even got a kick out of seeing the HMS Surprise, the ship from the movie Master And Commander, which is now moored in San Diego not too far from the U.S.S. Midway aircraft carrier. Both were facinating to tour.<br /><br />Let\'s face it, no matter how extravigant the hotel, most people use it to sleep and shower so that they can see the real sites in the area.<br /><br />As for natural beauty, I would have liked to see listed destinations such as:<br /><br />1. Clearwater Lakes in Canada, these two lakes (Clearwater East and Clearwater West) are connected to each other but were formed by two separate meteor strikes millions of years ago. They can only be reached via sea plane from Montreal. You bring your own camping and fishing gear. The lakes are so clear that you can see more than 60 feet down in the water -- hence their name.<br /><br />OR<br /><br />2. Manicouagan Reservoir in Canada which is a ring lake 40 miles in diameter formed from another meteor impact. The lake is actually only the very center of an impact site that is over 125 miles in diameter. The Manic 5 dam is the reason we can now see the ring lake from space! A trip to this lake requires a long trip on the trans-labrador highway which is mostly a dirt road (that far north dirt roads are actually safer than paved roads). Use your SUV and plan your fuel usage well!<br /><br />I\'d like to see this book redone with more destinations as mentioned above rather than resorts. It seemed as though the author solicited financial backing by advertising these resorts.<br /><br />Some resorts should continue to be included such as the Greenbrier in West Virginia.

The main problem was one of emphasis on the superficial and little comprehension of major historic or cultural sites. I will give a few examples:<br /><br />Patricia Schultz\'s method of organizing the 1,000 sites meant that entire cities were lumped as a site and she then clustered 10 suggested sites within that description. This resulted in major omissions. When discussing Madrid she gives the fantastic Prado Museum 2 sentences. When discussing Paris, she gives the overwhelmingly important Louvre only 5 sentences.<br /><br />Golf clubs and 5 star hotels are given more coverage than major battlefields, homes of international figures, and museums. For example, the Amsterdam red light district is given almost as much coverage as the Rijksmuseum. The few maps were totally insufficient.<br /><br />When discussing New Mexico, major sites such as Tent Rock National Forest or Bandalier National Forest are never mentioned. Alabama is not mentioned despite the Civil Rights Museum in Birmingham which is directly across the street from the 16th Street Baptist Church where 4 little Black girls were killed by a bomber.<br /><br />There were a few good points:<br /><br />Paestum\'s Temple of Neptune, Turkey\'s Hagia Sophia, India\'s Pushkar Camel Fair, Florida\'s Sanibel Island, and Boston\'s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum were all well described.<br /><br />Yet, we also had to read about Boston\'s Legal Seafood, a good restaurant that has many equals across the nation. Chez Panisse was given a page while the San Francisco Museum of Contemporary Art was not mentioned. Oahu hotels get plenty of coverage but Pearl Harbor gets only 16 words!

The compact size of the book was favorable, but I didn\'t know that would mean it also had compact, 20-second guides per city. When it actually started to get interesting, it went onto other popular, well-known cities, and then finally onto her excellent selection of hotels and cabins and the like. The author should also have put into consideration the fact that most people who ARE considering a grand, World-scaled Tour, or even a brief vacation somewhere exotic, either can NOT afford such excessive luxuries on a daily basis, or they will not be WILLING to; I\'m sure many people consider abroad tours just for the heck of it, i.e. backpacking--like myself. Hotels are nice, banquets are nice and the pretty sights are all nice, but I wanted more information on cost-efficient lodgings and fun, adventurous, & foreign Farmer\'s Market brunches, and most importantly, more tour sites.

It was sort of depressing for me to read about the many wonderful places I want to visit and realize I won\'t get to some of them due to lack of time and/or money.

As a traveler, many of the sights that have taken my breath away occur not in the big Western cities, but away from the path that so many typical tourists take.

I don\'t subscribe to either party, since the book certainly has its flaws - and yet it is still a worthwhile volume for the traveler to own.  I\'ll explain why.<br /><br />It\'s a mistake to look as this book as the end-all book on travel destinations.  Don\'t think that the places in it are the only ones visiting (they\'re not).  Don\'t think that you have to see them all if you want to think of yourself as well-traveled.  Don\'t use it as a checklist, checking off each place that you\'ve seen and looking forward to the next ones you can check off.  In order to see everything in this book, you\'d have to have lots of time and money as well as an adventurous spirit.  It\'s not the last word in traveling.  It\'s only one view of the subject.  It can\'t please everyone.  Adventurous travelers will find it lacking; so too will shoestring wanderers and vagabonds; and so too will the idle rich.  The mistake may be in the book, but I think that it\'s rather in the reader who expects too much.<br /><br />The best way to view this book is as simply another guidebook, albeit one that as a larger scope and a different approach than most.  Like other guidebooks, it has two purposes in this regard.<br /><br />1) It can provide ideas for trips.  Many people would not think of climbing Mt. Kiliminjaro, but this book shows that it\'s really not so out of reach.  Thus, this book can give the reader ideas for future trips that he may not otherwise think of.<br /><br />2) It can be used as any other guidebook - to give some guidance to the traveler.  If you\'re going to be spending a week in Paris, for example, flip to the Paris section and see what tis book suggests.  It\'s quicker, easier, and more effective than trying to sort through three hundred pages of a guide that\'s only about Paris.  It can thus be very useful for a \'highlights\' trip.  This is where the hotel, restaurant, and tour recommendations come in.<br /><br />As some readers have pointed out, it can also function as bedside reading.  It wouldn\'t be my first choice for this - an actual travel narrative is probably better - but if you like reading a page about how you can go to the North Pole for $16,000, this book may be for you.<br /><br />I give it four stars.  Is it worth the money?  Probably, unless you have a great aversion to tourism and even travel in general.  I recommend it to anyone who plans on doing lots of traveling in the future.  Just remember that its not the Bible of traveling, and that you\'re best off using it as a source of recommendations.  If the hotels and restaurants don\'t fit your budget, ignore them.  If you\'re frightened of the sea, ignore the sailing and diving sections.  Take from it what you can use, and you\'ll find it a worthy volume.',NULL,4),(457,191,'Excellent Gift for Young Travellers','For someone that loves to travel and aspires to see all 7 continents, like me, this is the perfect book.

Yes, the book mentions several hotels, but if you read the whole page, you see it also discusses the great southern California beaches and the San Diego Zoo, which almost anyone who travels there already knows about!<br /><br />I had never heard of the hotel and thought, \"How can a hotel be so special?\", but I went to see it and it really was beautiful and rich with history. I would have never seen it if it weren\'t for this book. The trick is to see the hotel and walk around, not overpay to spend a night in each one she mentions. I spent my half-day in San Diego walking around the hotel, then walking along the Coronado beach, watching navy jets land, and walking around all the shops and cafes on Coronado Island. It was great!<br /><br />This is a book that takes you on a journey to multiple sites for each place it mentions due to the illustrative writing, as well as provides you with addresses, phone numbers, websites, and advice such as the best time to visit, or a great restaurant to eat at while you are in the area.

Impossible!<br /><br />However, my curiosity took over when I read the small print \"On and off the Beaten Track\", because I am truly an \"off the beaten track\" kind of adventurer.<br /><br />So, after venturing into the book, I soon formulated a completely different mindset.  First of all, I realized that I had already seen some, if only a few, of the 1,000 places mentioned.  Then, I realized that this was not an assignment but that I could simply pick and choose from a listing of 1,000 places, some of which would be of most interest to me.  Of course, no two people share exactly the same interests in destinations; however, this book magnificently paints a picture of what one can expect if one should intend to visit, for example:  the Heidelberg Castle in Germany or the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam or the Oldest Tourist Route in Europe - The way to the Cathedral of Santiago De Compostela in northern Spain or even New York City.  Add to this small listing another 995 world destinations.<br /><br />I found this book absolutely fascinating because it took on the mantle of being my personal guide to many, many, many places I may have heard about but have never seen and may never actually visit.  It became my destination encyclopedia and most certainly increased my knowledge of world geography many fold.<br /><br />Even to a person who won\'t or can\'t travel, this book will provide a wealth of information about 1,000 diverse, interesting, amazing and truly unique world destinations. .<br /><br />Along with my collection of National Geographic magazines, I plan to keep \"1,000 Places to See Before You Die\" handy as a mandatory reference book before I embark on another adventure, be it domestic or overseas.

It was a huge disappointment. The hotels aren\'t even ones that most people could afford to stay in (much less a military family with 4 children).

In the case of Alaska the author recommends a couple of places that any 80-year-old on a cruise would be likely to visit.  She does not mention Katmai National Park (where you can get up close and personal with bears catching salmon) or any of the other places that an Alaska resident might recommend.  In the case of Massachusetts she recommends Legal Seafoods.  This is a chain restaurant and if you\'re hungry in Washington National Airport it is a fine place to eat but it is hard to see how the various branches of Legal\'s qualify as one of the 1000 top places in the world.',NULL,3),(477,191,'Something for everyone','Some of the negative posts are confusing a menu with a meal.  The book is the former and is used to pick a trip, not plan one.  But what many say is true, the 5-star rating can\'t be given because of the book\'s ridiculous overemphasis of hotels and resorts and because of its overemphasis of North America and Europe.  Sure, no two people would agree on all 1000, but having been to about 250 of hers, I think I can safely judge that any list that picks the Litchfield Hills in Connecticut over the Serengeti or Pike Place Market in Seattle over the Karnak Temple in Luxor or Fatephur Sikri in Agra is indefensible.  Hopefully Ms. Schultz will read these reviews and eventually make a second edition that trades some spas for lesser known but fantastically compelling places in non-Western countries.

I was expecting to find things that you would contemplate planning a trip around.  I had high hopes for this book, and came away disappointed.<br /><br />The main reason I was disappointed was that the author seems to LOVE hotels and restaurants.  I didn\'t count how many, but I would guess about 30% of the things to see are hotels and restaurants.  Personally, I don\'t care enough for hotels to believe that they account for 30% of the must see things in our world.  I would prefer that the author lists sites to see, and then give recommendations for where to sleep and eat.<br /><br />Another thing I found disappointing was the structure of the book.  It was not laid out very well.  Sometimes, the thing to see was very big and should have been broken out more.  For example, the things to see in Hawaii were listed as Maui, Kauai, Lanai, Oahu, and the Big Island (basically all of the major islands that comprise the state of Hawaii).  It is like saying the things to see in the United States are Illinois, New York, California, Florida, etc.<br /><br />If you plan your trip around hotels, this is the book for you.  If you do not, I would recommend looking elsewhere.',NULL,2),(480,191,'should be titled \"1000 Hotels to See Before You Die\"','The problem with publishing a travel guide to the 1000 Places You Must see Before You Die is establishing a fundamental criteria as to what constitutes a \"must see\" sight.  Is it historical relevance?  Natural wonder?  Intrinsic beauty?  World renown?  You get the idea.<br />How you answer that question goes a long way to determining what sort of book you will have.  The problem with Schultz\'s book is that she never clearly addresses that question and, therefore, has aggregated a series of recommendations that, in trying to fit all audiences, never succeeds in fitting any particular audience.<br />There has been much criticism in previous reviews of her focus on hotels/resorts, restaurants and \"obvious\" tourist attractions.  Obviously, these folks have a very much narrower view of what constitutes a \"must see\" venue than does Schultz.<br />This is the factor that drastically limits the utility of this book-in trying to be all things to all people it serves the interests of very few people.<br />Frankly, it seems obvious to me what is needed is a series of \"must see\" books based on narrow criteria, such as \"The 1000 Natural Wonders You Must See Before You Die\" or \"The 1000 Architectural Marvels.....\" or the \"1000 Best BBQ Places You Must eat At....\", and so on.<br />Having said all that, this tome does indeed provide, for certain geographical areas (primarily North America and western Europe) a decent generic guide to key attractions along a very wide continuum of choices.  That is to say, this would be a good starting point to plan out a trip, but should not be considered a good `sole source\" as a travel guide.

Personally, I could care less whether I see or stay in some $500/night hotel in, I don\'t know, Rome, as long as I get to see the sights and experience the culture there.

First off, I can udnerstand if your going on vacation or planning a splurge for a special occasions, you\'ll want a nice hotel, fine I can deal with that, but if she wants to put \"and off the beaten path\" in the title I don\'t think that every single one of these should be that way do you? I was severely peeved when reading about the great pyramids of giza as half way through the description she goes on about the best hotel near by that has an 18 hole golf course, because when I think about seeing the last of the intact ancient wonders of the world, I immediately worry about how it will press into my short game.<br /><br />Then, as a born and raised New Yorker I was more than pleased by her description of our city, only to have any respect I had grown for her dashed by her horrid list of \"must sees\". I\'ll go to the museum of natural history for a high school field trip, not for seeing one of the greates cities in the world thank you very much. Every thing she listed was the absolute biggest tourist trap I have ever heard of. She lists tons of over priced and over rated hotels, that I myself have never stayed in but I have eaten at several. Let me tell you this, I payed $22 for a chicken ceasar salad that was possibly the worst I have ever eaten. Yet if she had looked into it thoroughly ennough maybe she could mention that you can get the best homemade deserts in the world in Little Italy for next to nothing, and can get authentic chinese dinners (either the stereotypical stuff you can get at any take out place or what the real chinese eat) containing huge portions of food in China Town. Maybe she could have mentioned that you could make out like a bandit shopping with a few haggling skills while walking down the fashion district, or any street consisting of street vendors (I got a silk chinese bag for $2 the other day merely because the button to close the flap was missing, I don\'t even miss it and anywhere else I may have payed up to $30).<br /><br />I won\'t be completely harsh though, there are definately a few gems in here, but there is simply so much crap that you have to sift through to get to them it barely seems worth it.

Her way with words gives the reader a front row seat at the many places she wrties about. I might not be able to stay at the wonderful 1000 places she describes but I want to go there and experiece the beauty and fun of all of them. It is a joy to read and if I get the chance to see just a handful then the rest I feel like I have experienced.

It\'s too darn heavy to be so small!  By page 35, my wrists were exhausted!  And, what was the publisher thinking by using such small margins.  It was so tightly bound that I frequently had to \"split\" it open - and the margin around the edges where the user holds the book - well - I spent more time shifting my fingers so they wouldn\'t cover the text than I did reading.<br /><br />Finally, there should be a all inclusive checklist that the reader can mark those places he/she has visited.<br /><br />Would not purchase this unless you\'ve got REALLY strong arms.',NULL,1),(512,191,'Dr. Michael L. Johnson','342 pages on Europe.<br /><br />45 pages on Africa.<br /><br />As many have pointed out, the list is so skewed and biased as to be insulting. The writing is often not useful, or focuses on misleading aspects of an area. Why talk about the hotels and not the sites?<br /><br />The other review I find useful is that this focuses often on things to see, not things to do. Besides, as another reviewer pointed out, it simply isn\'t adventerous: often discussing going to locales to see a place, instead of the expereinces of traveling and actually engaging in areas.<br /><br />And just to reiterate:<br /><br />342 pages on Europe.<br /><br />45 pages on Africa.',NULL,2),(513,191,'Ignorance of China makes everything suspect','This book should be titled \"1000 hotels to stay in before you die\".
